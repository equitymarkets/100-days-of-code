# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 20, 2020].

## Log

### R2D1
Today's Progress**: I downloaded an emulator to play with old Commodore VIC20 BASIC programs. I went through a few old commands, including LIST, NEW, and PRINT. I also refreshed myself on the FOR loop and build a small program to make some little characters appear to  scroll down the page. 

Thoughts: During a trip to my parent's house over the holidays, I was cleaning out some old drawers. I found a manual from my first computer-a Commodore VIC 20 and I decided that I would work through the exercises, some of which I had done so many years ago, and some of which I hadn't (I was a very young kid at this time with a short attention span.) I really believe looking into this old manual will enlighten me on some basics about computer science that are overlooked in today's tech-heavy environment, but that, nevertheless, remain very relevant to understand.

### R2D2
Today's Progress**: Today I used the NEXT command to move on to the next line in the program and the POKE command to point to a place in memory. I will undoubtedly learn more about these commands in the future, as I have just started Chapter 3 in the VIC20 manual. 

Thoughts: I forgot how much fun the BASIC computer language was a long time ago. I really feel blessed that I found this manual. Sometimes I learn by really stepping back and exploring things that are very basic. Today was a lot of fun.

### R2D3
Today's Progress**: I learned about the existance of the PEEK command, although I wasn't able to get it to work. I learned more about the old memory location address method that was used on Legacy machines. I am glad to be exploring BASIC this week. 

Thoughts: As usual, I am learning a lot given the simple nature of this, especially about memory locations and the theory behind them. This is going to be a week well spent.

### R2D4
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about accessing memory locations using the screen character codes and color codes memory map, while incorporating background sounds. I made a simple up-pointing arrow, changed the background color of the screen, and put it to a random beeping soundtrack. 

Thoughts: I really think if I didn't have to work tomorrow I could stay up all night going through this BASIC manual and coming up with different programs and tweaking them. I see what captivated people in the 80's to become developers-there is so much you can do with this programming language.

### R2D5
Today's Progress**: I worked with more BASIC animations, using the "FOR T = X TO Y: NEXT T" method to make animations on the screen. I also changed some keys on the emulator to accomidate keys that I don't have on this keyboard (the emulator assigns all keys by location and this laptop doesn't have the amount of keys that the original VIC20 had).  

Thoughts: Last night I really wanted to keep coding all night. I love the retro feel of BASIC, especially learning about memory locations, etc. Maybe I enjoy it because I like history and the 1960's-1980's were so formative to the computers that we use today. In playing with animations, I see how old video games would have been made. It seems simple today, but at the time those games were state-of-the-art.

### R2D6
Today's Progress**: I am learning animations. I used to PEEK command, although I don't feel I can completely explain it, nor put it to use in every way intended. I used and IF THEN statement in BASIC, which is a little different than present-day if statements, but along the same lines. 

Thoughts: There are always challenging days during the 100DaysofCode challenge and today is one of them. After working this morning for 3 hours I had my second client cancel after I got to their house. Then I found out my daughter has been hospitalized for bronchitis. Although I am sure she will be okay she is spending at least one night here at the hospital to be monitored because of her young age (8 months). So I am doing today's segment by her side in the hospital.

### R2D7
Today's Progress**: Today I experimented with sound. I have yet to make songs or anything of the sort, but I tried two programs-once which produced a tone based on user input and another that produces a rising tone. I am working on making that tone reverse once it hits its highest pitch. 

Thoughts: While the BASIC computer language is antiquated and certainly has been replaced in its entirety by Virtual Basic, I am doing this to learn more about early computer science, particularly computing power in the 1980's at its most basic level (the VIC20 wasn't even the most powerful machine of its day, but it had a lot of capabilities nonetheless). While I had planned to finish BASIC and move on to another language in Week 2, I have decided to spend another week on it.

### R2D8
Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to stack FOR loops in this type of language-it really wasn't complicated at all. At first I was trying to use a GOTO statement to repeat the notes but with my limited knowledge I was not able to get out of it. I did find an example to escape a GOTO statement by using an IF statement but I didn't need it-I simply used NEXT to effectively nest the two FOR loops and play the 256 note sequence, with a set note length, and actually escape at the end POKEing the note generator to 0. 

Thoughts: Today I feel like I finally got it and today was the first day that I just sat down and did my own program using the stuff I have learned (and reviewed) for the first seven days. I'm really interested in mysteries that have a true nature about them and number stations and similar radio transmissions are enthralling to me. When I found the white noise generator in this manual I couldn't wait to do something like this. After some sleep I think I will come up with more things to do with it all.

### R2D9
Today's Progress**: Although the program isn't much, I spent about 4 hours today learning about BASIC conventions, in particular, making sounds. While this isn't nearly the most efficient way to create songs, especially nowadays, it would be a good bottom-up approach for someone really learning the musical scales. 

Thoughts: Today I had some time given that some of my students were off on a field trip. I was able to spend some time in the morning learning about producing notes with the DATA command.

### R2D10
Today's Progress**: Today I played with the INPUT and GET commands as well as variables. 

Thoughts: I am surprised at how similar BASIC actually is to many of today's languages. While I realize that the capacity of newer languages is much better, many things remain the same, such as variable assignments and assigning user input to variables.

### R2D11
Today's Progress**: Today I nearly finished the old VIC20 book that I have been reading and practicing from. I am hoping that I will get some insights from old BASIC programming that I can apply to more advanced languages such as Python and C#. I solidified my knowledge with the GET command as it applies to work with string inputs, and the $ specifier. 

Thoughts: I am still enjoying my journey through the 80's in BASIC. I want to do one final project summing up what I have learned in this beginner's book-I plan to be done with BASIC by Day 15 and start learning Javascript to use on my Riceforest project.

### R2D12
Today's Progress**: Today I experimented with the way that files would be saved 35 years ago-by using a virtual tape recorder on the emulator. It did not work to save the document however, in what I think was a glitch in the Java application, because I followed all directions. Either way, I learned how it was done. Additionally, I translated some variables and operators from BASIC to C#.

Thoughts: Although my posts don't seem to be generating much interest on Twitter, I am learning a lot each day. In several days I am moving on to Javascript, to eventually get back to work on my Django website project.

### R2D13
Today's Progress**: I linked my Github account to FreeCodeCamp and started the Basic Javascript Intro class. 

Thoughts: I am happy to finally be working on learning Javascript. The concept, so far, I understand, but incorporating them into my project will take a lot more study.

### R2D14
Today's Progress**: Today I used push() and shift() to removed the last and the first items from an array, completing the "Stand-In-Line" problem on Free Code Camp. Nothing else gave me too much difficulty, but I also learned about strict equality and strict inequality operators, which was new to me. 

Thoughts: I really like the way Free Code Camp teached the information, with the dual-window showing what needs to be done while letting you do it and giving feedback at the bottom. Very nice! The attached problem was the one I found to be challenging.

### R2D15
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot more about the switch statement, and its possible use to avoid a lot of "if else" type nomenclature within the code, which can make a program clunky, slow, and hard to read for other contributors. 

Thoughts: Once I realized that a numberic value does not contain quotations in the case (makes perfect sense now), I was able to move on in the lesson with ease. It is a bit late now and I think I will hold off on the card counting problem for tomorrow. The code included is the problem that gave me a challenge.
