# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 20, 2020].

## Log

### R2D1
Today's Progress**: I downloaded an emulator to play with old Commodore VIC20 BASIC programs. I went through a few old commands, including LIST, NEW, and PRINT. I also refreshed myself on the FOR loop and build a small program to make some little characters appear to  scroll down the page. 

Thoughts: During a trip to my parent's house over the holidays, I was cleaning out some old drawers. I found a manual from my first computer-a Commodore VIC 20 and I decided that I would work through the exercises, some of which I had done so many years ago, and some of which I hadn't (I was a very young kid at this time with a short attention span.) I really believe looking into this old manual will enlighten me on some basics about computer science that are overlooked in today's tech-heavy environment, but that, nevertheless, remain very relevant to understand.

### R2D2
Today's Progress**: Today I used the NEXT command to move on to the next line in the program and the POKE command to point to a place in memory. I will undoubtedly learn more about these commands in the future, as I have just started Chapter 3 in the VIC20 manual. 

Thoughts: I forgot how much fun the BASIC computer language was a long time ago. I really feel blessed that I found this manual. Sometimes I learn by really stepping back and exploring things that are very basic. Today was a lot of fun.

### R2D3
Today's Progress**: I learned about the existance of the PEEK command, although I wasn't able to get it to work. I learned more about the old memory location address method that was used on Legacy machines. I am glad to be exploring BASIC this week. 

Thoughts: As usual, I am learning a lot given the simple nature of this, especially about memory locations and the theory behind them. This is going to be a week well spent.

### R2D4
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about accessing memory locations using the screen character codes and color codes memory map, while incorporating background sounds. I made a simple up-pointing arrow, changed the background color of the screen, and put it to a random beeping soundtrack. 

Thoughts: I really think if I didn't have to work tomorrow I could stay up all night going through this BASIC manual and coming up with different programs and tweaking them. I see what captivated people in the 80's to become developers-there is so much you can do with this programming language.

### R2D5
Today's Progress**: I worked with more BASIC animations, using the "FOR T = X TO Y: NEXT T" method to make animations on the screen. I also changed some keys on the emulator to accomidate keys that I don't have on this keyboard (the emulator assigns all keys by location and this laptop doesn't have the amount of keys that the original VIC20 had).  

Thoughts: Last night I really wanted to keep coding all night. I love the retro feel of BASIC, especially learning about memory locations, etc. Maybe I enjoy it because I like history and the 1960's-1980's were so formative to the computers that we use today. In playing with animations, I see how old video games would have been made. It seems simple today, but at the time those games were state-of-the-art.

### R2D6
Today's Progress**: I am learning animations. I used to PEEK command, although I don't feel I can completely explain it, nor put it to use in every way intended. I used and IF THEN statement in BASIC, which is a little different than present-day if statements, but along the same lines. 

Thoughts: There are always challenging days during the 100DaysofCode challenge and today is one of them. After working this morning for 3 hours I had my second client cancel after I got to their house. Then I found out my daughter has been hospitalized for bronchitis. Although I am sure she will be okay she is spending at least one night here at the hospital to be monitored because of her young age (8 months). So I am doing today's segment by her side in the hospital.

### R2D7
Today's Progress**: Today I experimented with sound. I have yet to make songs or anything of the sort, but I tried two programs-once which produced a tone based on user input and another that produces a rising tone. I am working on making that tone reverse once it hits its highest pitch. 

Thoughts: While the BASIC computer language is antiquated and certainly has been replaced in its entirety by Virtual Basic, I am doing this to learn more about early computer science, particularly computing power in the 1980's at its most basic level (the VIC20 wasn't even the most powerful machine of its day, but it had a lot of capabilities nonetheless). While I had planned to finish BASIC and move on to another language in Week 2, I have decided to spend another week on it.
