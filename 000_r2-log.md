# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 20, 2020].

## Log

### R2D1
Today's Progress**: I downloaded an emulator to play with old Commodore VIC20 BASIC programs. I went through a few old commands, including LIST, NEW, and PRINT. I also refreshed myself on the FOR loop and build a small program to make some little characters appear to  scroll down the page. 

Thoughts: During a trip to my parent's house over the holidays, I was cleaning out some old drawers. I found a manual from my first computer-a Commodore VIC 20 and I decided that I would work through the exercises, some of which I had done so many years ago, and some of which I hadn't (I was a very young kid at this time with a short attention span.) I really believe looking into this old manual will enlighten me on some basics about computer science that are overlooked in today's tech-heavy environment, but that, nevertheless, remain very relevant to understand.

### R2D2
Today's Progress**: Today I used the NEXT command to move on to the next line in the program and the POKE command to point to a place in memory. I will undoubtedly learn more about these commands in the future, as I have just started Chapter 3 in the VIC20 manual. 

Thoughts: I forgot how much fun the BASIC computer language was a long time ago. I really feel blessed that I found this manual. Sometimes I learn by really stepping back and exploring things that are very basic. Today was a lot of fun.

### R2D3
Today's Progress**: I learned about the existance of the PEEK command, although I wasn't able to get it to work. I learned more about the old memory location address method that was used on Legacy machines. I am glad to be exploring BASIC this week. 

Thoughts: As usual, I am learning a lot given the simple nature of this, especially about memory locations and the theory behind them. This is going to be a week well spent. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/003R2_BASIC_VIC20]
### R2D4
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about accessing memory locations using the screen character codes and color codes memory map, while incorporating background sounds. I made a simple up-pointing arrow, changed the background color of the screen, and put it to a random beeping soundtrack. 

Thoughts: I really think if I didn't have to work tomorrow I could stay up all night going through this BASIC manual and coming up with different programs and tweaking them. I see what captivated people in the 80's to become developers-there is so much you can do with this programming language.

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/004R2_BASIC_VIC20COLORSANDSOUNDS]

### R2D5
Today's Progress**: I worked with more BASIC animations, using the "FOR T = X TO Y: NEXT T" method to make animations on the screen. I also changed some keys on the emulator to accomidate keys that I don't have on this keyboard (the emulator assigns all keys by location and this laptop doesn't have the amount of keys that the original VIC20 had).  

Thoughts: Last night I really wanted to keep coding all night. I love the retro feel of BASIC, especially learning about memory locations, etc. Maybe I enjoy it because I like history and the 1960's-1980's were so formative to the computers that we use today. In playing with animations, I see how old video games would have been made. It seems simple today, but at the time those games were state-of-the-art. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/005R2_BASIC_VIC20ANIMATIONS]

### R2D6
Today's Progress**: I am learning animations. I used to PEEK command, although I don't feel I can completely explain it, nor put it to use in every way intended. I used and IF THEN statement in BASIC, which is a little different than present-day if statements, but along the same lines. 

Thoughts: There are always challenging days during the 100DaysofCode challenge and today is one of them. After working this morning for 3 hours I had my second client cancel after I got to their house. Then I found out my daughter has been hospitalized for bronchitis. Although I am sure she will be okay she is spending at least one night here at the hospital to be monitored because of her young age (8 months). So I am doing today's segment by her side in the hospital.

### R2D7
Today's Progress**: Today I experimented with sound. I have yet to make songs or anything of the sort, but I tried two programs-once which produced a tone based on user input and another that produces a rising tone. I am working on making that tone reverse once it hits its highest pitch. 

Thoughts: While the BASIC computer language is antiquated and certainly has been replaced in its entirety by Virtual Basic, I am doing this to learn more about early computer science, particularly computing power in the 1980's at its most basic level (the VIC20 wasn't even the most powerful machine of its day, but it had a lot of capabilities nonetheless). While I had planned to finish BASIC and move on to another language in Week 2, I have decided to spend another week on it. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/007R2_BASIC_VIC20RISINGTONE]

### R2D8
Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to stack FOR loops in this type of language-it really wasn't complicated at all. At first I was trying to use a GOTO statement to repeat the notes but with my limited knowledge I was not able to get out of it. I did find an example to escape a GOTO statement by using an IF statement but I didn't need it-I simply used NEXT to effectively nest the two FOR loops and play the 256 note sequence, with a set note length, and actually escape at the end POKEing the note generator to 0. 

Thoughts: Today I feel like I finally got it and today was the first day that I just sat down and did my own program using the stuff I have learned (and reviewed) for the first seven days. I'm really interested in mysteries that have a true nature about them and number stations and similar radio transmissions are enthralling to me. When I found the white noise generator in this manual I couldn't wait to do something like this. After some sleep I think I will come up with more things to do with it all. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/008R2_BASIC_VIC20DATABURST]

### R2D9
Today's Progress**: Although the program isn't much, I spent about 4 hours today learning about BASIC conventions, in particular, making sounds. While this isn't nearly the most efficient way to create songs, especially nowadays, it would be a good bottom-up approach for someone really learning the musical scales. 

Thoughts: Today I had some time given that some of my students were off on a field trip. I was able to spend some time in the morning learning about producing notes with the DATA command. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/009R2_BASIC_VIC20MUSIC]

### R2D10
Today's Progress**: Today I played with the INPUT and GET commands as well as variables. 

Thoughts: I am surprised at how similar BASIC actually is to many of today's languages. While I realize that the capacity of newer languages is much better, many things remain the same, such as variable assignments and assigning user input to variables. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/010R2_BASIC_VIC20GETSTATEMENT]

### R2D11
Today's Progress**: Today I nearly finished the old VIC20 book that I have been reading and practicing from. I am hoping that I will get some insights from old BASIC programming that I can apply to more advanced languages such as Python and C#. I solidified my knowledge with the GET command as it applies to work with string inputs, and the $ specifier. 

Thoughts: I am still enjoying my journey through the 80's in BASIC. I want to do one final project summing up what I have learned in this beginner's book-I plan to be done with BASIC by Day 15 and start learning Javascript to use on my Riceforest project. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/011R2_BASIC_VIC20GETCONT.]

### R2D12
Today's Progress**: Today I experimented with the way that files would be saved 35 years ago-by using a virtual tape recorder on the emulator. It did not work to save the document however, in what I think was a glitch in the Java application, because I followed all directions. Either way, I learned how it was done. Additionally, I translated some variables and operators from BASIC to C#.

Thoughts: Although my posts don't seem to be generating much interest on Twitter, I am learning a lot each day. In several days I am moving on to Javascript, to eventually get back to work on my Django website project. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/012_R2_BASIC_VIC20RANDOM]

### R2D13
Today's Progress**: I linked my Github account to FreeCodeCamp and started the Basic Javascript Intro class. 

Thoughts: I am happy to finally be working on learning Javascript. The concept, so far, I understand, but incorporating them into my project will take a lot more study. 

Link to work:** []

### R2D14
Today's Progress**: Today I used push() and shift() to removed the last and the first items from an array, completing the "Stand-In-Line" problem on Free Code Camp. Nothing else gave me too much difficulty, but I also learned about strict equality and strict inequality operators, which was new to me. 

Thoughts: I really like the way Free Code Camp teached the information, with the dual-window showing what needs to be done while letting you do it and giving feedback at the bottom. Very nice! The attached problem was the one I found to be challenging. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/014R2_JAVASCRIPT_THEQUEUE]

### R2D15
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot more about the switch statement, and its possible use to avoid a lot of "if else" type nomenclature within the code, which can make a program clunky, slow, and hard to read for other contributors. 

Thoughts: Once I realized that a numberic value does not contain quotations in the case (makes perfect sense now), I was able to move on in the lesson with ease. It is a bit late now and I think I will hold off on the card counting problem for tomorrow. The code included is the problem that gave me a challenge. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/015R2_JAVASCRIPT_SWITCHCASES]

### R2D16
Today's Progress**: Today I solved the card-counting algorithm but I am still working on the "Using Objects for Lookups" Module. I am still learning about switch statements. Today I also learned that in Javascript what one would typically call a dictionary in Python is called an object. I don't know all of the differences, however. 

Thoughts: I am hitting some speedbumps now that the code is somewhat past beginner-level. I enjoy the challenges though. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/016R2_JAVASCRIPT_CARDCOUNTER]

### R2D17
Today's Progress**: I definitely slowed down when I got past 50% on the Free Code Camp Basic Javascript Lesson. Using objects for lookups proved to be a challenge and now I am working on the JSON data manipulation problem. I haven't finished it yet so I don't know if it will prove too difficult, but as tired as I am the instructions are a little difficult to untangle right now. 

Thoughts: I was introduced to JSON when I did some Data Visualization in Round 1, so I am aware of it and have used it in the slightest way through Jupyter notebook Python files and through a code injection on the website I am working on. Once again, I am scratching the surface. I hope to understand it much better soon. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/017R2_JAVASCRIPT_OBJECTLOOKUP]

### R2D18
Today's Progress**: I finally got through the record collection problem. Although I needed some hints, the Youtube tutorial was explained in such a way that I learned a lot from it.  

Thoughts: Although I teach HTML and CSS at a very basic level, I really have, up until this point in my career at least, avoided Javascript in any rigorous capacity. I have done copy and paste and have even written a line or two here and there, but I have never learned even the basics. It it good to know that a lot of what makes up JS fundamentals is so similar to languages that I know a bit more about, like C++ and Python. I really, to this point, had never dove deep enough into the language to even know that. 

Link to work:** []

### R2D19
Today's Progress**: I am almost finished with the Free Code Camp Beginner Javascript Module but right now, at around 98% complete, the lesson is about recursion and I don't want to rush through it with a tired mind. I will get on it tomorrow. Today I learned about ternary operators in Javascript and the const type, although I want to review that again tomorrow as well. 

Thoughts: I would like to be finished with this module so that I can get into slightly more difficult aspects of the language but I realize on doing some of these, mainly the ones dealing with querying objects, that my Javascript skills are lacking and need to be much higher to attempt the project that I have been attempting. 

Link to work:** []

### R2D20
Today's Progress**: Today I tackled two more Recursive problems on the Javacript curriculum on Free Code Camp, and finished out the module. I then started on the ES6 module. 

Thoughts: I am really having a problem with the home keys on this Lenovo laptop that I am using and am typing this with an on-screen keyboard. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/020R2_JAVASCRIPT_RECURSIVE]

### R2D21
Today's Progress**: I am still having problems with this keyboard. Today I learned about arrow functions and destructuring.

Thoughts: I need to fix this keyboard.

Link to work:** []

### R2D22
Today's Progress**: I am learning more about destructuring. Moving on, I have entered the template literals module.

Thoughts: Problems that would not have made sense a week ago now come with ease. I cannot say that I completely understand destructuring but I know what is going on and I can form simple scripts now. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/022R2_JAVASCRIPT_DESTRUCTURING]

### R2D23
Today's Progress**: I solidified my knowledge of string literals using the new ES6 syntax, although I am still not sure what I was doing wrong the first time, as all of my code seemed to make sense. I really thing I had a curly brace or comma or the like in the wrong place. Now I am studying constructors. 

Thoughts: The module on creating strings using template literals took me too long-I worked yesterday for a while on it but didn't count that day because I didn't have any progress. I understood the flow and the for loop and even made a while loop for the same result, but I wasn't getting the right output until I restarted with the old code from the beginning. Perhaps I had deleted something important.

### R2D24
Today's Progress**: Things are going good at work and much better financially but now time is the deficit. I once again worked on this several hours yesterday but wasnt happy with my progress so I didn't count it. I did have a major aha moment when I inserted a javascript function into an html button on a document that I simply type in Notepad. I feel like webdesign is right around the corner for me.

Thoughts: Knowing a bit about HTML and CSS, I always thought JS was complicated but now I realize there are many things about it that I alredy knew, since I have a fair understanding of C++. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/tree/master]

### R2D25
Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about getters, setters, and constructors, as well as html injections.

Thoughts: Javascript is certainly complementing my ability in CSS and HTML. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/025R2_JAVASCRIPTCGS]


### R2D26
Today's Progress**: I finished the Free Code Camp ES6 Module. I plan to move away from Free Code Camp for a while to go back to my Django riceforest.com project, but not yet. I am really enjoying being able to add Javascript to my HTML and CSS work and I really think this will supercharge my web development skills. 

Thoughts: I stayed up late tonight to finish the ES6 module. I feel good about it but don't completely understand all of the use-cases of these tools. At least I have been introduced to them.  

Link to work:** []


### R2D27
Today's Progress**: I did some javascript lessons today, messed with a little bit of HTML and Python, and opened a my virtual environment via Powershell for the first time in a while. 

Thoughts: After 127 days of coding and posting on Twitter and Github as well (I don't think anybody reads these posts except me), and furthering my knowledge in many languages including but not limited to Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, BASIC, Powershell, and C#, I finally feel like I am really "getting it" and moving from a beginner to someone who actually knows a bit about development. That comes from seeing and using Javascript in a way that I somewhat understand from languages like C++ but being able to inject it into HTML markup. This is going to be an interesting journey. My project is way behind schedule, but I can feel that it is about to start moving forward. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/027R2_JAVASCRIPT_SEARCH.REGEX.ETC]


### R2D28
Today's Progress**: I dove into my Django project and did some refresher routines on PowerShell, tried to fix some imports in the templates file, but really didn't make any measurable progress there. I did a good amount of Javascript lessons on Freecodecamp though, mainly dealing with Scripts and matching. 

Thoughts: I'm not quite ready yet to incorporate the JS I have learned into my project because I don't have user files on my database yet. This was the hangup from before. Once I get that momentum going, combined with my daily JS practice, I think I will be able to incorporate something good for an unfinished but usable website. The reason why I say unfinished is because I am starting to have second thoughts about immediately incorporating the blockchain element into the trade site, but time will tell.

### R2D29
Today's Progress**: Today I used variou regular expressions to query strings for various characters. While it is not the most interesting thing, I think it is very valuable (most things that are on the boring side do have great value in many ways). 

Thoughts: Working with strings is good because it is the foundation of querying databases or even the web. I'm thinking, in some respects, this is the most valuable thing I learned since Big O notation in Round 1. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/029R2_JAVASCRIPT_REGULAREXPRESSIONPT2]


### R2D30
Today's Progress**: I worked with regular expressions in Javascript and learned how to set up and execute a simple Buy order in Python LEAN library via Quantconnect. 

Thoughts: I am finding regular expressions to be a bit boring but I will get through it. I do not find it difficult. It's just hard to work on them time after time. After about 15 minutes, I did something I have had on the backburner for about a year and logged into Quantconnect to complete some tutorials. I switched my preference from C# to Python. I think for a while, my main focus should be on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. These are the languages that are immediately relavant to my present projects, and I now find C# to be a bit clunky and wierd. I still consider it of great value and I realize that Python is really just an abstraction of C, and therefore slightly slower, but I am going to stick with Python for a while. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D31
Today's Progress**: I got home late from work tonight but wanted to get at least an hour in. I am not sure if I want to memorize basic Regex scripting or just keep an easy reference guide link lying around. 

Thoughts: It's ironic because today I taught SAT and one of the reading passages concerned whether search engines are dumbing us down or making us smarter. The paper was neutral; it mentioned positives and negatives of both. I am faced with this same dilemna tonight. I know Regex is important for my Riceforest project but I don't know whether I should bother drilling these excercises to the point where I have it memorized, or to just keep the link and search when necessary. I was happy that I figured out how to

### R2D32
Today's Progress**: I reviewed some HTML markup and used some of it on my project site. Mainly, I manipulated input fields, and although I have not configured my site to add that input into SQL yet, its great working on UX. 

Thoughts: I finished the Javascript basic Regular Expressions module but I still have a lot to learn with them. I am past the "copy and paste" stage at least but I am still questioning what exactly everything I am typing actually does. I realize that is the second stage of learning and that I have about 10 more until I fully understand what every character means. Perhaps I will make flashcards. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D33
Today's Progress**: Today I learned the console.clear() function, as well as using type of and splice() to manipulate data.

Thoughts: I really need to re-prototype my site to decide what jobs are going to be done in JS and what I will do with Python/Django. I feel good about today overall, even though I wasn't presented with any huge challenges on freeCodeCamp-I did the whole debugging chapter with ease. I am a bit stuck on a Quantconnect Python problem, even though I have seen and typed the solution, I am going to memorize it and understand it in order to move myself on. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/033R2_JAVASCRIPTSPLICE]



### R2D34
Today's Progress**: Today I solidified a lot of knowledge that I have been slowly learning the last few years about CSS. Understanding the different between an ID and a class was a huge moment of clarity, as well as the fact that certain methods of CSS override others (inline overrides a class, !important gives priority, etc.). While I don't have all of it memorized, I understand it and I know where to find it. I also worked on some Quantconnect Python exercises, and some FreeCodeCamp Javascript Data Structures. 

Thoughts: Today I learned about the existance of, and got some entry-level practice in, the for...in statement.  

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/034R2_JAVASCRIPTFORIN.js]


### R2D35
Today's Progress**: Today I learned to write a function to find the factorial of a number. It took me longer than it should have. In the end, the solution was pretty short. 

Thoughts: I am hoping that excercises like this will come quicker in the future after I have done them a few times. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D36
Today's Progress**: Yesterday and today I worked on both CSS and Javascript via freeCodeCamp. I revisited arrow functions and was amazed how quick something that was unclear came afterwards. 

Thoughts: Arrow functions still looked strange to me until today. I will make sure I revisit them tomorrow. After I did the review it all made a lot more sense.  

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/036R2_JS_RETURNMATCH.js]


### R2D37
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about new algorithms in Javascript and worked with a lot of design CSS. I discover Bezier Curves. amd many other design tools. I also learned to use the filter() function and to write a quick function to sort small arrays in Javascript. 

Thoughts: My summer break is coming up so I want to do a lot of coding like I did last year. I would like to advance my Javascript knowledge so that I may become a good developer. I have purposely put off doing any projects so far this round so that I could further my overall computer science knowledge from a broad perspective. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D38
Today's Progress**: Today I did the rest of the freeCodeCamp tutorial on HTML/CSS Applied Accessibility. I have already coded some of these new methods into my project. 

Thoughts: Well after hearing a podcast a few weeks ago regarding why accessibility matters, I found coming up on this content to be very welcoming. Although there were no heavy challenges in this part of the chapter, many of the techniques I have immediately put to use on my project and I want to roll out a few more when I review this. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D39
Today's Progress**: Today I learned one appication of, and thought about the use of, a temporary array within a function to store variables. If anything is missing so far from my coding journey, it is the ability to tackle intermediate-level problems. I also began with constructors, learning more about "this" and "instanceof". 

Thoughts: I believe some of what I learned today will help take my coding to the next level. Some days, I still really do feel like I don't quite "get it" but when I look at programs I did a year ago (pre R1 100 Days of Code) I realize that although it doesn't come as quick as I would like, it comes with clarity. The more I learn, the faster it comes. I must press on!

### R2D40
Today's Progress**: I was able to integrate some of my new HTML and CSS knowledge today upon starting a new eCommerce project, including gradient colors and the <main> tag for content. I dove into Django to start on the backend as well. 

Thoughts: I did a lot yesterday and today but I love coming back to Python with a little bit of knowledge gains on the first 100 Days of Code. 

Link to work:** []


### R2D41
Today's Progress**: Today I was finally able to rename a project in PowerShell by giving 2 arguments. The solution was simple-I needed to put both arguments after the rename command without brackets. I also learned that using meta keywords no longeer works for SEO. 

Thoughts: I think by watching some tutorials on ecommerce I will be able to design my site soon. It will be a lot of work but ecommerce is perhaps soon going to be the only retail to stay in business. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/041R2_HTMLMETA.html]


### R2D42
Today's Progress**: Today while teaching an online class I threw together a list of ten words. Then I assigned standard index numbers to each word (starting with 1 for simplicity). I give my student a number from -9 to +9 (not 0) and he then figures out what I am actually saying. I think this is a great way to start teaching the students about encryption. I also worked on a Django ecommerce project so that my family can start selling products online in the near future. 

Thoughts: One of the best ways to learn something is to teach it. With coding on my mind lately, it came natural to mix in some basics of encryption into one of my lessons. Since this class has recently gone online, I feel good about teaching them skills that I think will help them in the future.

### R2D43
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the TEMPLATES: {'DIRS': [path]} and why I need to be careful if I delete that path in settings.py for Django. I also finally was able to get Django to find my static files-I was trying to link the static directory without a redundant project name folder above them (which I had done in the past but didn't know the significance of). I learned that it is used so that Django can find it, since the word 'static' is used often within the framework.   

Thoughts: To prepare for my next career (as a developer) I have to learn to fix problems in a serious and timely way, instead of just putting them off and finding something else interesting. From now on, I am going to work through problems while learning all I can about everything else as I go. No matter how boring this may seem, it is the barrier to entry between hobby and career I think. 

Link to work:** []

### R2D44
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little bit about Django, a little bit about ecommerce, and a little bit about CSS Flexbox. I learned the concept of a slug, which is a way to generate a valid URL from a word or nickname that is unacceptable as a URL. I learned a little about CSS Grids. I found the site codepen.io, which I am going to consider using for teaching in the future. I learned how to comment out code in Visual Studio Code, which is now my editor of choice. I learned a bit about naive datetime and cookie vs. session-based messaging. I will take a deep dive into CSS grids tomorrow.   

Thoughts: I am currently on summer vacation for my teaching job here in Thailand. Since class is not guaranteed to commence on May 1st, I am not 100% sure that I will have a job then. I have decided to pursue learning development full-time. This will keep my options open so as to avoid any loss of time between jobs if that happens. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/044R2_FLEXBOX.CSS]

### R2D45
Today's Progress**: I spent some of the morning looking at different browsers to determine usability with HTML5 and Javascript ES6 (now that I know and understand the versions) and discovered caniuse.com, a nice website to test compatibilities. I moved on to the CSS Grid chapter of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, trying to visualize how and why each command works the way it does. I also studied some Django as it relates to my eCommerce project, watching some of a tutorial that I really only half-understand. I learned more about namespaces, objects, and attributes. When I hear an unfamiliar word I look it up and read the documentation. I finished a couple Javascript challenges as well in the object-oriented programming module of freeCodeCamp. I am still working with constructors. 

Thoughts: This is my second day of working full-time to make myself a better coder. At this point I need to slow down and start getting used to looking things up in the documentation. 

Link to work:** []

### R2D46
Today's Progress**: Today I took a deeper dive into the codepen.io development engine. I really like the layout. I had planned to start on the first Responsive Free Code Camp layout, but got interested in playing with the Beginner's Codepen tutorial and started writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript without looking anything up just to see what I could do without reference. This is maybe the first time I have done something like that, but definitely not the last. It feels good to know the basics. I also used to Inspect Element browser tool on a few websites to get a feel on what other developers are doing. Just two days into my full-time experience, I feel like the deep dive is really helping me. I no longer feel like it is about coding non-stop-as I progress it might become more like that, but right now there is so much to learn I know if I want to develop anything of quality I will have to see the work of others.  

Thoughts: I had planned to make Round 2 more of an all-around view into coding. While I focused on Python in Round 1, I decided that Round 2 would be a journey into many of the languages that I use, and have used, during my entire coding experience, going all the way back to BASIC in the 1980's. Just knowing how to view other people code, today, mostly HTML with a little CSS, is great. I can't believe I had never used the tool to "inspect element" until Friday.

Today's Progress**:  On Day 3 of my full-time pursuit of a coding career, I learned some more about basic object-oriented programming by doing some Free Code Camp Javascript lessons. I started a paper to write down definitions of terms related to OOP that I half-know, so that I may know them better, or explain them if someone were to ask. I learned more about constructors, primitives, subroutines, and factories. I also worked in some basic HTML and some Python refreshers. I also worked for a while in CSS "gridding" one of my projects with an added container element.   

Thoughts: I really enjoyed the learning today. I wrote down everything that I wanted to work on by hour and I was able to do that, for the most part. I am remaining flexible for when I find priorities. For example, today while working into intermediate-level Javascript, I realized I didn't completely understand some of the terms. That is when I made my list of terms to know inside and out.

Today's Progress**:  Today I spent the early-morning hours working on cloning an existing Django project from Github. I got it working, even copied some of the code over to burn the images into my head. Later, I worked on CSS grids and finally on Javascript Object-Oriented Programming. I am making progress as far as just understanding Full-Stack webdesign more and more each day. It is a long road but I can feel the intuition coming on as I work through various challenges and projects.   

Thoughts: I find the end of the Javascript Object-Oriented Programming module to be very abstract and strange-all the talk about the prototypes and constructors and ducks and dogs is a little hard to follow. I guess there is a point to it, but I don't quite see it yet. It's hard to tell sometimes whether I really understand something just because I got the answer right. I know it is probably a few days away but I will get it.

### R2D49
Today's Progress**: I have decided that for a while I want to focus on front-end, while still learning a few more things about back-end as I go. This is because I want to get my ecommerce site at least up and running so that I can be sure to keep some work coming in in case my work as a teacher does not start immediately in the new school year beginning May 1st here in Thailand. My dream is to work for myself remotely so this will be a great start for me, but I must stay focused. Today I learned a method to make images much more responsive and stay situated neatly on the page. I have attached what I have so far. Next I need to add links to the pictures, assuring that they stay the same size when linked. 

Thoughts: I have now been working at programming full-time for a week. I have actually found it very productive to split my time between youtube tutorials, reading, coding a variety of different languages for personal projects, and learning computer science terms and concepts as I go.

### R2D51
Today's Progress**: Today I delved into the Free Code Camp curriculum to finish the Object-Oriented Programming module in Javascript. I learned about mixins, which use a collection of functions when inheritance doesn;t make sense or isn't the best option. A privileged method is a method that has access to private variables. Closure is the concept that a function always has access to the context in which it was created. The IIFE, or Immediately Invoked Function Expression, is a function that is executed upon declaration. 

Thoughts: Since today is a weekend day, I only coded for an hour and allocated my time more to learning than to project creation. As I really haven't integrated Javascript into my projects yet (to any reasonable extent), I wanted to learn some of it today.

### R2D52

Today's Progress: Today I worked most of the day on refactoring my first website from 10 years ago. Most of it was done through a web editor, some parts of which I still don't use efficiently. Now that I know a bit of HTML and CSS and don't feel I need a web editor I find that there are many things I can simplify, particularly the long class names, and repeating style sheets all over the project. I also finished my Free Code Camp tribute page to Jim Thompson. 

Thoughts: As an American living in Thailand I really find the story of Jim Thompson to be interesting. He acheived so much in his young life but was not content yet. He started a multinational corporation to export Thai silks to America and other countries, but one day wandered off into the jungles of Malaysia never to return.

### R2D53
Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed CSS media queries and worked with radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons in HTML.    

Thoughts: The full-time days are paying off. WHile I can't get through the material as fast as I would like, I am getting much faster at starting sites from scratch and making them responsive at least.

### R2D54 
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on some old projects, refactoring CSS and HTML according to responsive web practices. I also worked on the Project No. 3 from Free Code Camp. 

Thoughts: I feel like I am making progress in leaps and bounds. When I look at work that I did 3 years ago, I see that I really didn't understand much. Hopefully 3 years from now I will be able to look back and will feel the same about today. Learning and designing takes time. I am giving it a lot of time now because what was once a hobby and a side responsibility has a chance to become a full-time career. It feels good to have a skill now.

### R2D55
Today's Progress**: Today's work focused on three things: 1. CSS Flexbox and its application to responsive web design, 2. More semantic HTML, instead of using <p>, <h1>, <span>, and <div> at every instance, and 3. The soft skill of finishing something instead of moving on to something else. All of these things will help me if I plan to do this for a living in the near future. 

Thoughts: While I learned a lot today about markup, my main focus was practice-finishing something to completion by the end of the day. This is going to be a skill I must polish. It is easy to get stuck on something then move onto to something more fun or interesting. But if I plan to do this as a career in the future I must get used to deadlines. Today, while I am still on the slow side at getting pages to do exactly what I want, I remained determined to finish so that I may move onto something else later. I feel good that I did that. Of course, the page still can use some work, but it passes all the tests and that was a challenge.

### R2D57
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on CSS mostly all day. I learned that flex can be used (very) effectively on top of grid, as in when using a media query. On top of getting much better at HTML and CSS, I am navigating Visual Studio Code much better as well. I think I will take some time to learn more shortcuts at some point.  

Thoughts: I am nearing the end of what I wanted to do in this project. I started planning to make it responsive but then found so many things in it that I know how to do so much better than 10 years ago when I built it, or even 2 years ago when I last looked at it. I am glad I have untangled it

### R2D59
Today's Progress**: Today I worked in the Free Code Camp Curriculum for Javascript Functional Programming. Although most of these problems have simple fixes, I like to work on them and study them until I really know what is going on, which takes a lot longer than just finding the fix. I encountered a [Circular] return in an array today. I like to focus on errors in the code, because I find that is when I learn the most.   

Thoughts: I took an hour break from the Design projects, but later I will continue working on them. I am almost done with the HTML/CSS section of the curriculum.

### R2D60
Today's Progress**: I finished the Project #4 from Free Code Camp, this time quickly going through the unit testing and fixing each small problem much quicker than before. I read some React documentation, did some Vanilla Javascript exercises on Free Code Camp, and did a SQLite Tutorial. Although Django abstracts out a lot of the SQL commands, I want to be familiar with it, at least more so than I am now. Today I constructed a small database comprised of one table, and fetched the data from it.    

Thoughts: I decided today that I want my webdesign business to be called something with the word lasers in it and use this page as kind of a demo for creative work. It has a ways to go but I like the subject and the content.

### R2D61
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a little bit of HTML, a little bit of CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. I also read a long blog post about SEO in 2020 and have a page full of notes. I learned one thing that I immediately implemented on one of my projects-have a meta description on every subpage, not just the homepage. 
'
Thoughts: I was a bit tired today because I woke up an hour earlier than normal, so that I could be finished earlier in the day. I finished a logo for my portfolio page and did the meta descriptions on the exterior contractor page. I also cleaned up some CSS on another project.

### R2D64
Today's Progress**: Im working on a couple CSS mini-projects that are taking up a lot of time. I am also preparing to start trying to get some freelance work on some of the freelance sites to increase my skills in the upcoming months.  
'
Thoughts: I will always feel like I don't know enough or am not quite ready but the fact is the only way I am going to learn is to dive right in. After developing off-and-on as a hobby and in my full time work as well, but never as the only thing, I know I am ready and know the real skills will start to kick in when I have a job to do.

### R2D65
Today's Progress**: I finally figured out the solution to the problem publishing to Github pages-the case-sensitive nature of the interface and the .jpgs that I was using, some of which were upper-case and some of which were lower-case. 
'
Thoughts: I'm really glad to be getting some demo pages for my work out there. I know that having a business doing what I love will take some time but right now I know that my time is going to have to be balanced between marketing and self-improvement/study. The marketing is the hard part of course but every business needs to do it.
