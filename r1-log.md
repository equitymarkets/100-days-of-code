# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 18, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: I learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. As I move through the 100 Days of Code challenge, I plan to refactor all or most of my code every 20-30 days. That way, I can: 1. revisit topics that I might not be clear on, and 2. use what I have learned to improve upon the code. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the one of the world's most favored languages. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### R1D2

Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to use .append() function, which will add an element to the end of a list, the import directive, which is used to bring in modules, and negative index numbers in a list, which can be used to reference indexes starting from the end of the list (index -1), rather than the beginning. Today's topic, "About Python", I intended to take a deeper dive into how and where Python is used, while learning some basic functions as well. With the "import this" directive, the console loads "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, a prose relating to the mission of the Python language. At the end of the program, I import "antigravity", which loads a browser and takes us to a Python comic site. 

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive. With a basic understanding of the basics of computer programming, I should only need to look things up one time. While Python is very new to me, many methods are similar to other languages.

### R1D3
Today's Progress**: I made my first successful while loop in Python using the Fibonacci sequence and based on user input. I also learned my way aroung Github a little better. While loops seem to be used more often in Python than in other languages. I do know that they tend to use less memory. As time goes by I will learn more about why Python users temd to write while loops more often (if that is indeed the case). 

Thoughts**: Even though for loops are in many cases superior to while loops, the programs I have written for C++ and C# always used for loops so I haven't really used while loops much at all. As a beginner in Python I figured I would start learning the right way and use one to do a Fibonacci sequence, which I found a bit tricky at first. I learned the value of stepping away from the machine for a few minutes and coming back. I am not happy with the video presentation on Twitter, as the tweet was in two pieces, and my video and audio quality are still pretty bad. I am, however, happy with my progress in Python for the day.

### R1D4
Today's Progress**: Today I used a lot of new methods, including pop(), insert(), str(), max(), min(), stdev(), variance(), and mean(). I learned that I need to import the statistics module if I want to use certain methods. I created random numbers within a loop (my first Python for loop). I first used ctrl+y to undo a previous edit. Tomorrow I want to study more about definite vs. indefinite iterations. I do know that a for loop represents a definite iteration, while a while loop represents an indefinite iteration. 

Thoughts: I learned a lot today but I felt that it came quicker than before. I feel my journey is well underway now. I had some problems first importing the statistics module; it didn't seem as if I had that module at first but upon the second try, the auto-complete/intellisense kicked in and I knew at that moment that it was there. Everything worked from that point on. This is the second day that I ran into some roadblocks trying to do what I wanted to do. I realize that harder times are ahead but I also know that is the only way to really learn something.

### R1D5
Today's Progress**: Used pow() to raise a number to a power and bin() to convert an output variable to binary code. I also used another while loop today, creating an 'infinite loop' so that a user may input data as many times as needed to test the algorithm. 

Thoughts: Today, on Day 5, I finally felt like I can turn on the editor and start to write a simple program that makes some sense without having to look everything up. It is helping me to write things out on paper using a diagram or pseudocode before I just start typing. I think that is the key to writing efficient code. I really do, however, feel that it takes too long to crank out certain pieces of simple code, such as today's while loop. While I can type it quickly, sometimes putting a math problem into Python language proves to be something I have to look up. I am hoping to speed up soon. I still am producing crude videos on twitter but am going to try using a new app tomorrow to record video internally, while making multiple apps visible.

### R1D6
Today's Progress**: I learned about the sort() and sort(reverse=True) method, what the error message EOF means, ways to sanitize user input, and combining 'or' operators (in fact, I hadn't used an or operator in Python before-I was trying to type ||). I learned about the elif() statement but I didn't actually use it for my program, as I need to drill down deeper into the logic. I made ASCII art in the console, and even that was a bit of a challenge because I learned that I need to cut off the quotation marks right after the last character of input. All-in-all, I worked all day learning Python. Luckily, I am a teacher and am on summer holiday with the school system I work for, so I have time. 

Thoughts: Today was the most challenging so far. I really wanted to get the Monty Hall problem complete, but also wanted to sanitize user input and make a little bit of ASCII art at the top illustrating each of the three doors. The real challenge came at the end. After repeated testing, I knew that my probabilities were not coming out right. Continued manipulation of the if-else statements at the end finally gave me statistically accurate results. I also dealt with some hardware issues when I had a mouse freeze up. I found a good video editor but then I was having difficulty converting the .AVI file to .MOV or .MP4. Then I was able to convert but not able to upload to twitter. I finally got that problem solved as well but the public video will only play on an iPhone but not Windows10. I will add that issue to my to-do list for catch-up stuff. I learned more today than any other day and the reason I got caught up so many times was because I am pushing myself hard. I refuse to copy any other code, but insist on figuring out problems on my own.

### R1D7

Today's Progress**: Used append() to put user data into a list, len() to create a variable for the length of that string, and ' ,'.join() to remove the quotes from the string when using the data in a readable format (as output). 

Thoughts: I am getting in the flow. Things are taking less time, and I am starting to visualize how to create basic structures in Python, i.e. get it to do what I want it to do. First I wanted to put user inputs from a SWOT Analysis into a dictionary, but I decided that a list would make more sense, since I had no need for key-value pairs. However, I do understand that a much larger program could use a dictionary to decipher the inputs. I will consider this in the future. My streams are looking better when I record tham.

## R1D8

Today's Progress**: Today I configured some settings in IDLE and learned how to make a dictionary, as well as a dictionary within a dictionary. I used these tools to make another console app, this one explaining the planets in the solar system. 

Thoughts: The string at the bottom of the program (which is really the main part of the program) took some time. Getting the output to display only the values took a while to figure out. I did get it to work, but I am not sure if it was the most efficient way. I want to start testing runtime using different methods so that I will be ready when I get outside the console apps and start writing my first GUI in Python. 

Link to work**[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/8_SolarSystem.py]

### R1D9
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little bit about ways to sort through lists. I learned about the Bubble Sort, the Merge Sort, the Quick Sort, the Selection Sort, and the Heap Sort. I learned how to activate the sleep function with seconds as a parameter to slow a program down so that a user may read or examine contents of a console application. I wrote my first function in Python, using the def command. I learned about the range function. While I knew the range could normally assign the amount of iterations in a for loop with two parameters (e.g. range(1,20); start at 1 and stop at 16) what I did not know was that the range function can be defined with one parameter (e.g. range(16)) meaning count from 0 to 16 (stop at 16), and can be defined with three parameters (e.g. range(19,0,-1)), meaning, in this case, that the program is to count down -1(step)) from 19(start) to 0(stop). 

Thoughts**: I originally planned to do all five sorts in one program, but since these methods are new to me in the Python environment, I soon discovered that while it would be possible, I would be cramming too much data into one day. While the Bubble Sort might not be the most useful tool, it seems to be taught as the gateway to more useful (and complex) methods of sorting. I had some difficulty figuring out the logic when writing the code for the bubble sort, and I do plan to give it further study tonight and tomorrow because the Merge sort is more complex. For the five programs I would like to add on a sort of function that returns runtime and memory usage for each process (and other processes as well). As I approach Day 10, I plan to work on writing better code for familiar topics, while increasing related skills such as commenting code, appropriately naming variables, using hardware and software efficiently, knowing Windows hot keys to speed up my work, testing and speaking better during my presentations, and testing I/O across various apps, browsers, and operating systems.

### R1D10
Today I learned about the Merge Sort. The Merge Sort is very efficient and is in common usage. It is a bit complex to code at my level and seems to use a lot of memory for large data sets. I only used 10 numbers in this set. It is a quick algorithm, meaning it runs quickly through the processor.  

Thoughts**: I learned some basics today, including the "//" operator in Python 3, which, like the "/" operator in Python 2, simply returns an integer value, even if the expression has a remainder. I learned how to find a line in IDLE when there is an error by pressing Alt+G. I learned different ways to split the list using split() and using [:x] to find the x from the right of the set. 

LInk to work: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/10_MergeSort.py]

### R1D11
Today I streamlined a lot of my existing skills, streamlining a user-input for loop to create random variables, this time without naming each variable after an if statement. I learned the theory behind the quicksort, but didn't complete it yet. I plan to begin work on it again tomorrow. I learned better ways to use the 'i' counting variable within a for loop or while loop for indexing variables. All-in-all, I learned a lot.   

Thoughts**: I worked late because I wanted to finish the Quick Sort. Tonight when I sleep on it I think I will have new ideas in my head tomorrow. I did, however, learn exactly how it worked, so while I feel that I can explain it fairly thoroughly, putting it into code proved to be a big challenge. That is okay, because I am at my best when I am over my head in new information. I still have four more days of holiday until I return to full-time work so I am obviously pushing myself to learn all I can before I have a shortage of time.

### R1D12
Today I learned some good coding habits, including using the print() statement a lot, then commenting it out when I figure out if the snippet of code is working. I learned about the return statement, in that it can be used independently to end the execution of a method, or to return a value. I learned about index values, and collisions. In fact, I believe that is my problem right now with this program. I also learned how to separate a list (e.g. by < or >). This will prove a valuable skill as I continue to learn Python.    

Thoughts**: I worked all day and night trying to figure out how to get the code for this quick sort to work on my own. I don't just want to copy and paste large pieces of code-I want to spend the time learning it, making it, breaking it, and seeing my mistakes so that I can become a better programmer. While I probably learned more today than any other day, I am not happy with my progress because I still do not have a workable program. I will continue again tomorrow!

### R1D13

Today's Progress**: I learned a valuable script for creating random numbers with x = random.sample(range(a,b),y). I learned the meaning of partitioning, which, in this context, means to split a list into parts based on some criteria, such as a pivot value. I learned a drawback when coding recursive algorithms, such as the Quick Sort, which is that if there are indexing conflicts it can cause a stack overflow. I polished my skills in boolean user-defined preferences by asking the user if he/she would like to assign random variables or use a predefined set. So, my array was already defined, but if the user wants, he/she could change it. I also learned a convenient way to create multiple arrays in one line, with the script a,b,c = [][][]. 

Thoughts**: I feel good that I finally finished the Quick Sort. I learned that there are many different ways to do it, and that the way I was attempting in D11 and D12 was more difficult. I made a ton of mistakes today too though. Soon I want to research Big O notation to really understand how and why each of these sort methods are better at different times. I am sure that many complex algorithms examine the dataset first then use whichever set is most efficient. I would like to perhaps build a project on this in the future.

### R1D14

Today's Progress**: I used some new testing methods today, considering the algorithm I was working on involved iterations. I learned the theory of it, but want to explore the various ways that (it seems) one can compute it. It appears that the algorithm can be computed by selecting max values or min values, and can also involve splitting the data into two arrays, or simple popping and appending the existing array.  

Thoughts**: I work on this in the morning and at night. I had a large errand to run across town and didn't get as much progress as I would have liked. I do feel that things are coming to me more quickly now. Tomorrow I plan to learn the Heap Sort, which I think is very complex. Tomorrow is the day that I go to teaching (we have been on summer holiday in my school system) so I am going to do my best to finish the Heap Sort with any spare time that I have.  

Link to work:[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/14_SelectionSort.py]

### R1D15 
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a Heap Sort. It is a fairly efficient sorting algorithm. Memory usage when using it is low, the time to code it is minimal, and it is consistently fast, though at times not as fast as the Quick Sort. Actually, while I was learning about the Heap Sort, I learned a lot about indexing and visualizing a list as a heap, or binary tree. I also learned about the math.log2() function, which is very helpful when dealing with decision science. I do not know whether or not I will incorporate this function into the final version of my Heap Sort algorithm. I also learned more about recursion, why it is important, and why calling functions within functions illustrates it. 

Thoughts: Learning about something first before attempting to code it has major advantages. Today I learned to visualize nodes in an array form. While simplistic, it is a new way to look at things for me. As a side note, understanding recursion will make me a better investor, since I do incorporate algorithmic trading into my strategies. Being able to think about things in a less linear fashion will certainly make me less dependent on other's formulas and more able to develop my own indicators on more than just simple chart patterns. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/15_HeapSort.py]

### R1D16

Today's Progress**: Today I learned the uses of the floor() function (to remove the decimal portion of a number and convert it to the lower integer. It has its uses in the binomial tree when we are trying to index the parent node of the child, where the left side (2i) and the right side (2i+1) have the same parent. I also improved on translating pseudocode or code from other languages like C++ or C# into operable Python structures. I encountered the recursion error and found a way supposedly to cure it using the sys module but I didn't find it much value for my actual need so I deleted it-my error was still there and there wasn't much this fix would improve. I know it's there when or if I need it again but I didn't see a need to explore it any further. I learned the famous heapify() method and I wonder why that is not in the standard Python library since it seems to common and standard for this sorting method. 

Thoughts: As I stated on twitter several days ago, one of the things I have noticed so far about Python is that some activities that appear difficult are very simple to accomplish but some things seem simple but in reality are very complex. As I learn the syntax, I continue to struggle with indexing errors and adjusting the entire program so that they are corrected accordingly. I find some things to be unnecessarily complicated but I think that I am still trying to use C-like syntax for many tasks. I think once I start to experiment with the frameworks and libraries I will become more used to Python.

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/16_HeapSort.py]

### R1D17

Today's Progress**: Today I simply made a console application to compute binary and hexadecimal numbers. I used the standard python functions of bin() and hex(), then wrote custom functions to computer the numbers as we would manually on paper. I also practiced doing min() and max() functions on a set of numbers

Thoughts: Today I had to teach in two different parts of town and in the morning had to plan for the lessons for about two hours. I got home pretty late. So I wanted to do one of the lighter programs that I had planned. Using bin() and hex() turned out to be simpler than I thought so I decided to show the division by base method to show each step when manually representing numbers in base 2 and base 16 formats formats. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/17_BinaryandHex.py]

### R1D18

Today's Progress**: today I started on writing my own binary search function after practicing some other coding that I thought might be useful towards today's work but turned out not to be. I did learn about simplifying code using the list comprehensions, the sum() function to add up all elements of a string, the list() function to wrap a range into string format, and about avoiding an obscure error dealing with a name of one of my other files in my working directory (numbers.py). So I learned a lot. 

Thoughts: I didn't finish what I wanted to however. I really felt like I was prepared to tackle the binary search and the work started off well. Soon I ran into conflicts when I attempted to make my custom function recursive. I reworked it, trying to make it iterative, then I realized something else, that was fairly obvious. This should not simply be searching for a number that you know is there-there needs to be a boolean switch to determine if the number is actually in the list. All-in-all, that gives me two problems to work on tomorrow. As is usually the case, on the day that I feel like I got little done, I actually learned a lot. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/18_BinarySearch.py]

### R1D19

Today's Progress**: Today I redid most of my binary search program and got it working. I learned a lesson about naming variables exactly. Somehow, variables that are not named exactly just don't seem to fall in place, even though you think you know what they are meant to represent. I learned about returning a non-familiar object when a failure or error is encountered, such as -1 for a method that should under normal circumstances, return a zero or positive integer. I learned about the NoneType error, and that when I see it, it must mean that what I am looking for is not being returned correctly. 

Thoughts: I didn't think my binary search idea would take too long, with some idea of iterative and recursive sequencing in my mind now on the 19th day. However, refusing to just copy and paste, I worked through it for hours figuring out why each thing was the way it was and did what it did. The end result was a working binary search method. While it uses a simple array of one-off numbers (1-10 for indexes of 0-9), it could easily be scaled up. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/19_BinarySearchPart2.py]

### R1D20

Today's Progress**: Today I learned to work with a list within a list, learned all about recursive functions in Python, including base case and recursive case using if/else and calling global variables within a function, dealing with dictionaries vs. lists, and even a little about business planning in Python (at a simplified and theoretical level).

Thoughts: I started off wanting to learn more about recursive functions. I was sitting at a coffee shop looking over some simple examples, and thought about making a simplified profit example based on total purchases in a typical evening. Soon I was putting in some sales numbers for receipts, with each array within the dictionary being equal to one hour's sales. Since C# is my first language, it came natural to write an iterative function and I figured that I would leave that in, just to do the calculation both ways. I learned that in python, a dictionary value can only be listed once within an array, so what I originally planned to do as a dictionary turned into a list. Then I spent the remainder of the afternoon before my teaching appointment writing out basics for the recursive part of the program. As usual, I hit a few snags but I am up late again, finishing up this program. I will be tired tomorrow, but it is worth it, because today I really starting feeling natural at writing functions and even wrote my first recursive function without having to get any help from examples on the internet. I am pretty proud of that. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/20_ClosingTime.py]

### R1D21

Today's Progress**: I learned today how to better utilize multiple operations and functions within a method. I also learned to import and execute sound files to the application (.wav), using the correct format and file structure. This console application actually creates tap codes from input. In the future, I will fix it to do sentences. 

Thoughts: It is pretty obvious to me that this could be achieved with far fewer lines of code using a two-dimensional array. However, today, as well as yesterday, I hit no major roadblocks and that is a new experience. On Day 21 I feel like I am about ready to start working with real data and in a User Interface environment. In the next few days, I want to go over all my "to-dos" from Days 1 - ??? and also redo some of the coding from those days. If I keep making progress, today's app may be one of the ones that are redone. I see now that yesterday I really had an "ah-ha" moment when I began defining functions and calling them recursively. Today I defined two functions and nested one inside the other. I am making progress on this, but I know that I have just begun. I still feel like a Python beginner, but I definitely feel 21 days into it!]

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/21_MilitaryTapCodes.py]

### R1D22

Today's Progress**: Today I dealt with a "'list' object is not callable" error. It triggered because I was trying to use a list name as a function (the function and the array have similar names). I also learned that longer or complex programs should use "return None" values within functions for cleaner code. I learned how to set the Python environment variable in order to manipulate the program with the command prompt, then run pip to initiate and download modules. Finally, I started my first Github pull request. While the three main things I made the program do work as typed with no errors, I want to spend more time with them to see if I can make more use of them. My original idea is to view time to run, time to code, and total memory usage of the program for when I refactor my old word from the first days of this challenge. 

Thoughts: As usual, I learned the most when I was completely mixed up. I could not get the Python environment variable to initiate, despite leading it directly to the correct file path. I tried putting the semicolon in various places and typing different strings that I saw demonstrated on the internet (I had the same problem with Visual C#), but then I finally just went to install Python and chose "Modify" and checked the box to create the environment variable. My code is not doing exactly what I wanted it to do but it's doing what it's supposed to do. (The time.time() function is only measuring down to the tenth of a second, the memory function is returning a hexidecimal value, and the memory usage function I believe is giving information for my system, not the specific program. But it is good to know these tools and it was good to get caught up on the basics of finding modules and using them, because soon I will be doing data visualizations, so I need to be a little more fluent in system processes. I feel good about today's work. In one more week I will be working at my day job a lot more (the kids at the school I work are coming back from their summer break) so I need to be getting the "blocks" out now so that I can flow when I have less time in the evenings.

### R1D23

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the Python array arr.array(''[]), the list [], the dictionary, or associative array {}, and the tuple (). I have been using lists and dictionaries fairly extensively for the first 20 days of this challenge, and have referred to both of them as arrays, but today I learned about what is known as the Python array. I designed a simple miles per hour to kilometers per hour program that first defines two lists, then turns them to tuples, then manipulates the tuples. It is not anything spectacular, but it is another first because it is the first time specifically working with a tuple, at least working with what I knew was a tuple. I learned about the immutable nature of tuples, that this can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage, and the possible use-cases for tuples, one of which includes graphing environments. I did know that tuples are used often in QuantConnect discussions and in trading environments in general, but up to this point didn't know why. Now I feel that I am closer to understanding that. Since data-science is my objective on this challenge, I feel that I might be using the tuple more often in the future. 

Thoughts: I started out wanting to learn about the tuple, but also learned about the Python array as well. Up until now, I had been referring to lists as arrays, which I believe is correct, but not specific, since there is an actual array module and definition which include C-like type codes. Both the array and the tuple warrant further study, but I am happy with today's progress. As far as Python goes, I do wonder why for a language that seems to be built for simplicity, there are so many seemingly intentional complexities. Yesterday I was left wondering why the psutil module required a .whf extension vs. standard exe. as in the past. I also keep running into standard library methods in Python 2 that have been deprecated for Python 3. I wonder why there are so many differences or why old methods can't just stay possible without having to user-define them. I still am convinced that once I move beyond this "Hello World" stage, I will see why Python is rapidly becoming one of the world's most favored languages. Since I've had my run with a few C-likes languages, as well as html, CSS, PHP, and a little javascript, I will stick with Python for this 100 days of code challenge because I do want to become good at it, but whether or not it becomes my language of choice I do not know yet.

### R1D24

Today's Progress**: Today I cleaned up some of the old code that I wrote in the first days of the challenge and added to some of the newer code. I learned a lot about making methods from existing programs, and ran into a few new errors along the way, including a seemingly meaningless indention error and a problem with one of the programs which was using the global directive inside a nested function and would no longer work when made into a function itself. I fixed this by making that global variable local and changing the order of the parameters. 

Thoughts: As usual, I learned a lot. I added to my tap code program but now as it is it is in a perpetual loop (I'm fixing it to do sentences.) I learn the most when I have to figure out workarounds, and I did two of those today (as stated above).

### R1D25

Today's Progress**: Today I extracted and imported matplotlib for use in my application. I learned a new useful Python function, quit(), that can be used to get back to the standard command prompt when running Python from the command line. Moreover, I learned a lot about the Matplotlib package for Python, including basic functions used to create a line chart, bar chart, histogram, and scatter plot.  

Thoughts: I really like getting outside the console environment and into statistics and data visualization. I did not run into any major difficulties at all today. While I feel like I hit a major milestone, the fact that I had no problems with this tells me that I need to push myself a bit harder. After having to re-download and modify Python the other day when not being able to start pip from the command line to get psutil, it certainly was welcome to easily type pip install matplotlib and have everything work. I find the Matplotlib module to be very user-friendly and look forward to using it for a while in the next days of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

### R1D26

Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work with a line chart in the Matplotlib module. I saw today as an opportunity to learn move about Big O notation, and I wrote functions to generate a y output list using constant, logarithmic, linear, quadratic, and exponential time complexity. While I understand the theory, I will have to see more examples of code to solidify my understanding of what is what. I understand that the binary search is logarithmic, double loops are quadratic, and that most good algorithms fall in the n log n region.

Thoughts: Today I started to see the value of not just writing code, but writing clean and efficient code. While thinking about it, I theorized that most popular websites and applications tend to favor complex but streamlined code on the backend, to affect quick and relevant search results, and simple code on the frontend, so that most of the public can adequately use the product and get a job done, without having to navigate through a pretty but complex user interface. This helps to explain why the Big O Notation is important to understand for anyone striving for a good user experience, where users come to a site for speed and relevancy, not necessarily beauty.

### R1D27

Today's Progress**: Today I started building a supply and demand chart from Matplotlib. I found and imported cv for photos and was able to put a photo in the background of the graph. I used plt.figure(figsize=()), plt.annotate(), and plt.xkcd(). I also better visualized and implemented a linear relationship between the supply line and the demand line using a -num relationship in a for loop. 

Thoughts: Right now I really just want to clean up this graph. I need to get the resolution right on my graph, since I don't want to stretch the photo. I also need to figure out why when the image is inserted, the y-axis inverts, and figure out how to insert a little dotted line pointing to the intersection. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/27_SupplyandDemandPt1.py]

### R1D28

Today's Progress**: I finished a fairly simplistic supply and demand chart. I learned a lot, including a couple visual enhancements to the chart. I learned to invert the y-axis and used it as a workaround when inserting my image caused the y-axis to flip. I ended up having to go back to my image editor, flip the image, and turn it inside out so that it would fit this image. I also learned how to format a string using the '$' but wasn't able to use it to much effect on this graph. 

Thoughts: As planned, I am just about to go back to full-time days as a schoolteacher, so it looks like I will have gotten a good 30 days in before things get intense. I am happy to have made it this far but I know that things will get much more intense when I add 3-5 hours of teaching onto my morning schedule. I am prepared for the challenge but I know it will be difficult at times.

### R1D29

Today's Progress**: Today I learned a few more things about basic data visualization in Matplotlib, mainly basic visual enhancements to the histogram and the pie chart. I dealt with a Name Error: 'subplot' is not defined, and I dealt with it by importing pylab into the code. I also learned the pass keyword to leave a class empty in order to work on it later. 

Thoughts: I planned to get around 5 days on matplotlib visualizations then begin to work with the Pandas module. While I have been creating lists on my own, now I want to start importing the data from Excel spreadsheets. Tomorrow I will start on Pandas. Probably by Day 40 or before I plan to work on some of my past stuff and perhaps attach spreadsheets or more. I love this because I learn as I go. I feel I have come a long way in the last 29 days.

### R1D30

Today's Progress**: I was happy to make something more out of the work that I started on Day 4. I learned how to create a csv file as an export. Tomorrow I will work on importing the data. I learned about the concept of dependency with regard to files needed to make a program work. It is often the problem I have when I look at others' code on Github or anywhere else. If I can figure out more about dependencies: what to look for and where to put it together, I will be able to work with others' code better than I have in the past. This is where learning this from the ground up comes into play. I did learn the DataFrame method today and it worked on the first or second try. I plan to spend some time getting to know the Pandas module. 

Thoughts: I am happy to have made it to Day 30. I worked a long time today on a variant of this problem but was not able to make it work. I certainly have my to-do list ahead. I figured out how to make a dictionary out of a loop but have not been able to pass it to output via the Matplotlib and Pandas. I also need to figure out more about the 'Value Error: If using scalar values you must pass an index' error. I also need to look back to prior days and see all of the things that I have had problems with and figure them out now before I start to move along.

### R1D31

Today's Progress**: I worked with Jupyter notebook again but could not get it to do basic things like importing data. I will return to it tomorrow. Earlier today I did familiarize myself with the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python. I will put these principles into practice as I learn and create with Python. I did learn the .head(), .tail(), and .loc[''] functions. I also learned importing with .read.csv(''). 

Thoughts: I didn't get done as much as I would of liked. I spent a long time messing with Jupyter Notebook but I was not able to get it to do what I wanted. I will learn it. I may have to configure something-I am not sure. I did learn a little about JSON and plenty of new Python methods (see above). 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/31_PokemonSpreadsheet.py]

### R1D32

Today's Progress**: Today I looked back at a few of the things that I have intended to catch-up on. I solidified my understanding of definite vs. indefinite iteration. In a definite iteration, the terminal value of an iterator is known and the program repeats until that number is reached. An example of this is a for loop. A for loop specifies the amount of times the program will iterate. In an indefinite iteration, the program repeats until a value is true. An example of this is a while loop. The function does not know how long it will have to iterate, it only knows when it has reached the value, which is when it stops. I also finally learned how to navigate the Jupyter notebook. It seems I was saving as .py right in the beginning. By leaving the file open and letting the Notebook auto-save, I was able to see the .ipynb extension. I learned a few new methods and tools in Python, including .info() to get metadata about the dataframe, .shape to see the size of it in cells, .drop_duplicates() to get rid of duplicate values, and iloc[:] which warrants further understanding.  

Thoughts: I am glad that after three days I finally got Jupyter Notebook working. I stayed on it because I knew the problem was something small. I do not know if I will continue using it for the duration of 100 Days of Code but I may stick with it during my work in Pandas. At this point I want to get a working understanding of the Pandas module so I may be working with it for a while until I can do basic visualizations with it. Tomorrow I plan to continue my work from today on the coffee shop sales model.

### R1D33

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about calling the data from the spreadsheet by filename.columnnumber. One of the methods that I learned was the type(filename.columnnumber) to find out about the csv data. I also learned to plot a chart using that protocol. I learned about the hlines() function and all of its parameters. It is useful for showing a breakeven point, or, in the case of this graph, closing time when our profits do not exceed a reasonable value. 

Thoughts: The kids at my school come back tomorrow and I am supposed to be working three shifts so that will still give me time to continue this challenge, but I might not have as much time as before. I wanted to get about 30 days in before full-time hours start again and I was able to do that. I really have a good basic understanding of Python and a few of its modules now. Now I will be able to focus, albeit with a little less time on my hands. I've come a long way in a month-learning all about the shell, IDLE, Geany, and Jupyter, learning about while loops, for loops, and if statements, doing sorts and searches, and learning a little about Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. If the next month is half as productive as the last, I will be happy, but I think it will be more. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/33_PythonCoffeeShop.py]

### R1D34
Today's Progress**: I learned about the show_versions() method, as well as some lingo-the octet is 8 bits, or a byte; and a nibble is 4 bits and takes up one hex digit. I learned about memory addresses, which use hexadecimal notation so that they are easier to convert to binary from human eyes (than base 10), but not as long or difficult to figure out as binary. 

Thoughts: Today I got caught up on this. It's new, as I haven't actually done a chart directly from Pandas nor with the dictionay indexing so I figure it will take a while to figure out. I am sure tomorrow it will make perfect sense. 

Link to work:**[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/34_PandasChart_ASEAN.py]

### R1D35

Today's Progress**: While I didn't create the chart purely with a dictionary, which is what I originally wanted, I did get exactly what I wanted by typing the data into a spreadsheet and using read_csv. Today I learned to better use iloc[] to grab a whole column of data for use in plots. I learned how to use the Numpy arange() method, using bottom=last to stack bars, and plt.xticks() to specify the name for each value. 

Thoughts: Learning to quickly change gears and work around a problem is a valuable skillset. Since I am not on a clock I try to work through things as much as I can and then learn the workarounds later. Today, however, I really could not seem to get this plot to work using the dictionary. I know now, based on the last 35 days, that working with dictionaries is a weakness. In the future I will need to incorporate dictionaries into my work so that I will get stronger in using them. 

Link to work:**[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/35_PandasASEANpt2.py]

### R1D36

Today's Progress**: I learned how to make a sine wave using the np.sin() method. I learned how to make gridlines on a graph. I also learned how to make a horizontal axis line using axhline(). Finally, I encountered the ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension... and to remedy it I first just tried switching around values to make it at least run. I did get it running, but it makes no sense. Tomorrow and maybe the next day I will spend making something good out of it. 

Thoughts: I didn't get as much done as I would have liked but I believe that this will be an awesome visualization once I get it to make sense. Although it is only an idea really now, I learned a few things today. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/36_RedShiftpt1.py]

### R1D37

Today's Progress**: The main thing I learned today was a workaround. I didn't plan for the red shift / blue shift graph to be complex, I just wanted to make something that was correct, after yesterday's silly graph that didn't say anything really. When I set the wave on this graph using the sin() function I found that it would always be the same (I could be wrong about that but I think sine should always come out the same, shouldn't it?) so I had to work from another angle. I turned up the x-axis values from 10 to 20 and ended up with what I wanted. The problem was that it said 20 at the bottom which meant that red shift and blue shift were at the same frequency: not true. I used plt.axis('off') to turn off the x axis because I didn't need it to illustrate this concept. I think the plots look much better than yesterday's. 

Thoughts: I realize this isn't anything complex but before moving on (as my focus here is an overview of the entire Python language, not just data visualization) I wanted to just map a simple idea out using a chart, but not data intensive. I like this red shift / blue shift chart and my only regret is that it appears that my video might not want to play on browsers operating on a moderately slow speed internet. My video quality needs to improve. I also don't feel like I covered a lot of information today but I did learn the one function and learned some vocabulary about graphics.

### R1D38

Today's Progress**: Today I familiarized myself with kaggle.com for dataset practice and projects. I found a really annoying error that happens for really no reason at all-the unindent does not match error and to cure it I simply had to repaste the entire function-this cleared it up immediately. I used the .describe() stat function to describe the set I am reading from, but did not get everything I hoped for in that set. 

Thoughts: I dont feel like I got much done today, but I tackled a pesky error message, learned about a place to get practice data, and learned a new function. Tomorrow I hope to run this data at least through the bubble sort and the merge sort; maybe all five. 

Link to work**:   [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/38_DataProcessPt1]

### R1D39

Today's Progress**: I didn't make much progress towards a workable program but I worked through a couple snags, learned what would work and what wouldn't, and still ended up not much closer to what I want here. I did learn some housekeeping, such as how  to display file extensions by default on Windows (or Mac). I learned the Python os.getcwd() function for the current directory and os.listdir() for everything in your working directory, in my case a folder by the name python_work. I learned that a CSV has no data type and that is (I think) why I cannot churn the data into a sort function. I learned the word "delimiter" which means any character or group of characters to specify a boundary between separate regions in a datastream, such as "#" for comments. 

Thoughts: I still feel unproductive but all-in-all I did have a productive day at work-even found out that one of my private students got the highest-in-class mark on her test. By the time I got home I was pretty tired and this program still isn't doing what I want but, as usual, by the time I put it away I have learned way more than when things go smooth. When things are rocky, I tend to learn more about why this is, whereas when things are going smooth there is little to be done. I love the challenge. Tomorrow I want to get this working, however. 
Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/39_DataProcessPt2.py]

### R1D40

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the sort_values() function and a few of it's parameters. I planned to get a Pandas overview during the last few days and I feel I have done this. Today I imported a CSV, manipulated the data, and sent the CSV back out four different ways. I learned about the "Permission Error: [Errno 13] Permission Denied:..." Error, which happens when a file already exists. I also learned the term "in-place sorting," which refers to a sort that simply exchanges values within the list and does not use any additional space for sorting, such as with secondary or tertiary arrays. 

Thoughts: I had to put my idea of running the data through my five sorts on an indefinite hold until I know more about Python processes. I would like to pursue the idea, and perhaps when I come back to refactor all of the code in a week or so I will consider looking over the sort functions again.

### R1D41
Today's Progress**: Today I installed Seaborn using the pip install command line function. I explored several functions to set the style of the plot (sns.set_style()) and to set the type of plot (sns.scatterplot(), etc.). While I knew that Seaborn is built on top of MatplotLib, it didn't dawn on me that I would have to use plt.show() to display the Seaborn visualization. 

Thoughts: I am getting back into the rhythm of this challenge. I just finished my first week of classes of teaching at my school and my body is getting back on schedule. I want to take a good dive into Seaborn for the next five days. I really like the capability of this library. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/41_SeabornIntro.py]

### R1D42

Today's Progress**: Today I combed over some Seaborn built-in datasets. I also looked around in the Python site-packages folder and found where all of the modules are contained. I had been wondering where all of the includes are coming from so now I understand this a little bit better. I learned about unit-testing, the heatmap as a 3-dimensional plot, and about the Index contains duplicate entries error, although I still have not remedied what is causing it. I have work ahead for tomorrow. 
Thoughts: As always, I learned a lot when I was up against a brick wall. I am still up against the brick wall, but I want to think about this as I sleep. Often, I can do better if I return to something in the morning. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/42_SeabornHeatmapPt1]

### R1D43

Today's Progress**: I got the heatmap to work today. In the end, the problem was just the order that I was placing the arguments into the .pivot() function. By reading the standard 'Anscombe' dataset in the order ('dataset', 'y', 'x') I was able to get a logical heatmap plotted. The other error that I overcame was after I attempted to plot a clustermap. Originally (since my objective is to learn Python code and get acquainted with a number of topics-zooming in later) I tried to plot the clustermap to try it out without really seeing or knowing what a clustermap actually was-I was trying to put a string value into the map, which is not accepted. Eventually I just popped the string value out and the clustermap worked fine. 

Thoughts: I think it is good that Seaborn plots do not just accept bad parameters and plot what would really equate to nonsense. As a learner who is not on any hard deadline, it is tempting to get frustrated when something doesn't work but I know in the future the checks and balances that are built-in will be very beneficial to my work. I want to spend a few more of my 100 Days learning more about Seaborn basics and return to this library in the near future. At or around Day 50 I want to get acquainted with Django for some real world projects that I would like to finish, or firmly move towards a finish, by the end of the 100 Days. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/43_SeabornHeatmap.py]

### R1D44

Today's Progress**: Today I moved on learning the Seaborn library with the jointplot. I looked at an available example using variables defined within the actual program but I decided to work further with the 'flights' example dataset, because now I am really starting to grasp how to manipulate this data-a couple days ago I had no idea. I learned about bivariate data, some numpy functions, and the sns.jointplot() with many of the different alternatives (seems that there are many). 

Thoughts: While I don't know if data visualization will be my main focus of Python in the future, it is important to know, and I will be glad to have spent 20+ days on the subject material. As for today, I am putting a star beside the jointplot in my notes because it is something that I definitely want to explore further. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/44_SeabornJointPlot.py]

### R1D45
Today's Progress**: Today I learned the definition of Gaussian distribution: simple really, just a Normal distribution. I did this while I was learning the distplot() function and its application. It is funny how you hear things and never really solidify  what is being said unless you look it up or am working with it. I also learned the boxplot() function. I couldn't get this working the other night but now I have built the knowledge and confidence to work with, I believe, and of the Seaborn plots. 

Thoughts: While I understand how to use most or all of the Seaborn plots now (the coding part) I do not know what all of these terms mean. I want to further my skillsets in data science so that is on the agenda. Luckily, I did study basic statistics, so when I look these up the definitions and interpretation come fairly easy to me. I will work with Seaborn for 2-4 more days (2 more mini-projects) then I spend a session refactoring, commenting, and simplifying all of the code from my Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn work (Days 25-present). 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/45_SeabornDistplotBoxplot]

## R1D46
Today's Progress**: Today I worked with lists a bit in some console applications then went back to Seaborn to create a Swarmplot. The Swarmplot, also known as the Beeswarm, does not work too well with big data, mainly because point cannot overlap and are simply stacked on top of each other. Data might not be accurate if there are too many elements. I also learned some information towards my project. On or before Day 50 I plan to learn Django and start doing some web development, using some existing websites and ideas that I have developed in the past and adding a good backend engine so that they are ready to go live soon. I learned why website databases use functions like .lower(), .upper(), and .title() for storage of both usernames and passwords, e.g. data can be sanitized by giving a username a .lower() value than outputing it as .title(). I learned the keywords "in" and "not" and their boolean usage. 

Thoughts: I am enjoying my dive into Seaborn, alongside further study in Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas. While some of my knowledge is indeed memorization as opposed to actual deep understanding, I know that the deep understanding will come as I immerse myself in the Python language. On Day 46, I can say that I am pleased with my progress. Things are certainly starting to make sense now. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/46_SeabornSwarmplot.py]

## R1D47
Today's Progress**: Today I went through all of the basic plots and maps, coding most of them. I really wanted to further my knowledge of Seaborn before I move on (I do plan to return to and/or use this library in the future, and I will be cleaning up all of the code from Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn tomorrow). Tomorrow I will refactor all of my visualization code then move on to familiarizing myself with Django for a while. 

Thoughts: I know that I have barely scratched the surface of Seaborn. I worked on 17 plots and maps today, getting a deeper understanding of the module. I really like Seaborn and think I will find use for it in the future. At first I questioned why some visualizations were coded different from others, but I am starting to see why-for purposes of accuracy, checks are set up so that the user can't just put in any data. My focus for my Seaborn acclimation really was not to work with data, but was to set up the code so that I know the different visualizations in order to work with data in the future. So I used the example datasets and learned how to code the plots, but did not worry too much about what any of it meant. I am going to read through some of the documentation tonight so that tomorrow when I revisit all of my work I will have a better understanding of what is actually taking place in each plot or map. 

Link to work**:[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/47_SeabornWrapUp.py]

## R1D48

Today's Progress**: I learned the plt.subplots_adjust() function and most its parameters and the plt.suptitle() function to add a title on top of subplots. I also added hlines() and vlines() with max values on a supply and demand graph with a max value to terminate the lines at an equilibrium. Since I am interested in economics I think I will use this in the future. I still want to make this idea interactive at some point. Most of the stuff I learned today was stuff that I had been putting off as I made new material. What is awesome about this challenge is that things that seemed difficult a few days ago are much easier now!

Thoughts: I guess today was an average day. I worked on cleanly refactoring a few of the days and really cleaned up a few of the mini-projects but also hit a few stumbling blocks-strange that I can't even get the original code from those days to work. Well, tomorrow I have that to work on as well as some other refactors that will probably go by quicker. I am looking forward to cleaning up all of Days 25-47 on one page. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/Refactor/49_Refactor.py]

### R1D49

Today's Progress**: Today I finished wrapping all of Day 25-47 into functions, refactoring some code and improving the functionality of much of it. I learned the tight_layout() function to clean up a figure, the all() built-in function thats returns True if all values are true, and how to fix an unreadable CSV (I cut and pasted the data, created a new Excel workbook, and saved it in CSV format.) That workaround proved successful but I want to experiment with this problem further. 

Thoughts: I don't feel like I accomplished much, although I worked on this for over two hours. Continuously changing small pieces of code and rerunning the program was today's theme. I am glad I got those two programs to work as functions and learned the little CSV problem. I need to try reading Excel docs directly.

### R1D50

Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little about setting up a virtual environment on an operating system (mine is Windows). As usual, I don't feel like I got a lot done but I learned a lot. I learned how to open Powershell from a folder (shift+right click) and work in that folder. In fact, until a kind Twitter user helped me find the Powershell workaround, I was stuck using that standard cmd for the operation and it was getting stuck on something, perhaps a bad path, or multiple paths. I will remember to attempt using the Powershell next time I hit a roadblock. I also learned how to turn permissions on and off and why it can help to overcome errors. 

Thoughts: I stayed up pretty late tonight, but knowing that I have given my all and worked 1-6 hours a day for fifty days now really gave me the movivation to stick with it. I didn't even use any normal Python editor today, although I used Python in the command prompt in and out a few times. I really like the PowerShell workaround. So, as is usual on many days, I spent a long time getting little done, but it is very worth it because now I know things that I didn't know before, and I am using my skills to integrate and streamline an existing website that I hope to take live within a couple months. That's good news!

### R1D51

Today's Progress**: I could not get Django to work correctly today-I had a long day at work and was pretty tired when I came home. I did work on it for a while however, then switched over to something I have been meaning to do-translating some C# code into Python. My AI advancement theory, though incomplete, is something I want to complete during my 100 Days of Code. I will come back to it again when I take another break from the current things I am working on.  

Thoughts**: Although I work full-time, I need to start fitting in some time earlier in the day to code. At night sometimes it is hard to focus. I feel like I can be more productive if I am not working late into the night, then getting up early the next day. 

Link to work: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/51_AI.py]

### R1D52
Today's Progress**: The virtual environment is still not flowing well so I worked on finishing the C# translation of my AI program and will return to working on Django this evening. I am getting what is going on but maybe not fully. This type of environment is new to me so once it is working I will be all the better. I hope tonight I can get it going. So far I have learned about the venv CMD command to create a virtual environment, the existance of the wsgi.py file as a web service gateway interface, the cold start problem, and lambda function in Python as small anonymous pieces of code that can take multiple arguments but only have one expression. I dealt with the "Invalid Literal for int with Base 10" Error by commenting out all of the code below the error and working through it line-by-line-solving the problem that was escaping me the other night in several minutes. This illustrates the value of stepping away from the code now and then so as to better analyze a situation. 

Thoughts: Yesterday I worked all day, spent some time with my new baby, and even worked on installing the virtual environment for well over an hour but I didn't have any code to commit so I didn't count the day. I just can't wait to get Django working. After a short break today I will continue working with it. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/52_AIPar2.py]


### R1D53
Today's Progress**: Today I spent hours trying to figure out how to properly finish installing the virtual environment. While there may have been some progress made in my understanding of Windows dependencies and Python in general, I didn't get past PowerShell-I learned some PowerShell commands like mkdir, pip freeze, and run server, but I hardly was able to type much Python code at all. Yes, I learned a lot but it wasn't enough to get this project off the ground. 

Thoughts: I understand that learning any language requires some deep understanding of the operating system you are working on, so for that I am grateful for today. Leaning Powershell is also valuable for this experience, but I do want to get back to working on Python code, as per my goals during this challenge. I am now considering whether I need to be taking the Django route right now. I will keep working on it tomorrow. I need to get some theory in my mind and maybe then I can return to Python, PowerShell, and the Django Virtual environment. 

Link to work**:[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/53_VirtualEnvironment.ps1]

### R1D54

Today's Progress**: Today I spent some time working on the Virtual Environment again. I learned exit() which to my knowledge, functions the same as quit(), to leave Python and get back to the command prompt. I learned the three quotations to leave a long comment in the program. I did figure out the script to create the dependencies, and learned about the activate.bat script and its role in running applications. 

Thoughts: I don't want to get burned out from trying to figure out the exact way to setup a perfect Python environment. If I keep having problems with it I will skip a few things and start to code the project anyways. I have the environment set up but seem to have problems when I run commands like runserver or migrate. I will do what I have to do to keep moving and if something is over my head, I can come back to it when my knowledge of the Python standard library is better. My object here is to code for 100 days, not to do everything perfect every time. If I keep moving I will get better at this.

## R1D55

Today's Progress**: Today I marked a huge milestone: I finished setting up my initial virtual environment and ran commands on it, including startproject, migrate, runserver, and startapp. I don't think I will have problems quite like this again. I now have a much deeper understanding of Windows dependencies. Ironically, managing Windows dependencies around the index.html homepage, subpages, images file, etc. is something my students always have a problem understanding as well. Now that I am starting to set up directories in other environments, maybe I will also find this type of subject easier to teach as well. 

Thoughts: I spent some time today running all of the test to make sure that my app was indeed set up correctly and so far, so good. I'm very happy that such a simple thing is now done. I want to get started building my new website and using the existing assets that I have to start generating some traffic. It is a very exciting time.

## R1D56

Today's Progress**: Despite learning a lot of theory I didn't type too much Python code today-only some modifications in Models and learning about fields and the "max_length=" classifier. I did run into an error which I eventually fixed: "__init__()
missing one positional argument: "on_delete"". I fixed this by rewriting the topic attribute to have an on_delete parameter. The important thing was that I finally set up the final directory to begin my project. After what seems like an eternity (6 days) the virtual environment, migrations, and app startup are finished and clean and I am now working on the foundation of riceforest.com. So it is an exciting day despite not having much code to show for it. The link to work shows the powershell commands that work on my machine to get as far as I have as per the twitter video. 

Thoughts: Good things happen in different forms. I don't have a load of new code to submit today but my Django project is off the ground! I am very happy that I now understand Windows dependencies a lot better than before-I even redid the project so far so that it will be clean as I move forward (I had one extra folder that I didn't need.) I don't know how long it will take to roll out the riceforest project, but I would like to finish it, and a few other things, by Day 100.

## R1D57

Today's Progress**: My knowledge of hierarchical file structures is growing quickly. Today I even was in a conversation with a coworker about what he thought was slowing down his computer with a new app he was using. I was able to say so much more than just referring to the hard drive space and RAM.  It's amazing how this experience is so relatable to so many things. I never really knew how an app worked, and now I am on the road to developing one. I encountered a couple errors today: one is still occurring but my app is doing what I planned. I will troubleshoot the Powershell error tomorrow. 

Thoughts: I know I am making progress now that I am able to get back into the Python editor and type Python code. But the Powershell experience is helping me too. I want to explore the Models Field page more tomorrow.

## R1D58

Today's Progress**: Redoing, breaking, and fixing was the name of the game today. I am making this program work in its early stages, but I keep changing things to see what I can do with my final project as I progress. So far, I have been about to get things back to where they were each time.  

Thoughts: I'm really glad I decided to learn Python, With all the console algorithms in the beginning, the data visualizations in the middle, and the web dev foundations now, I really feel like I am developing a good skillset. Now it is time to start rolling out some productive work. I can't just learn forever, I want to go public with some quality projects. Sometime I work for hours and have very little quality code to submit by the end of my time. Even though I do often learn a lot when this occurs, I don't feel like I got much done in these cases. One big this I did learn is the format of a typical chain, like "from rice_forest.models import Objective", meaning rice_forest is the project, models is the file, and Objective is the class within the file. I guess I knew it was something like that, but to see it in action confirms my speculation. I hadn't really dove deep into the Python theory yet-I generally learn faster by doing stuff like this and learning it in practice. That is why I document all errors and fixes.

### R1D59

Today's Progress**: Today I did a few things. I worked a bit on the riceforest app, I read some documentation on Django Models Field, I worked on annotations in my 3D AI program, I made the visualization more user-oriented (it now changes according to radius inputs), and I made a global variable in the form of float so as to avoid hardcoding every snippet to change the user input back from string. 

Thoughts: I made progress on both projects today but it wasn't much. That is okay though because all of it has to be done. Slower days mean I learn more. If I am always just typing away at code, it means I am probably not doing anything I don't understand, and thereby not learning much. I feel the best thing I learned was working with python manage.py shell to examine data. Once I get better at interpreting the outputs for stuff like this, I will be a better and quicker developer.

### R1D60

Today's Progress**: Today I continued learning Django, then moved on to learning some visualizations in matplotlib and numpy-working for the 5th day on my AI visualization project. I learned about the .gca(projection='3d') function, learned about making 3D cubes in mplot3D, made some arrows, and encountered more than a few errors. I look forward to finishing the AI visualization soon. Actually, the visualization is the small part of this-the written content will require a lot of research. 

Thoughts: I think getting started in Django is unnecessarily complicated. I find it amazing that I will have something working perfectly, go back and tweak one or two things, and find an unworkable program. Then I will just delete the tweaks and find that the damage done to the program is unreparable and I have to go back in and start the entire project over. Now, I guess this is good in the beginning because I am learning a LOT about setting up a virtual environment, migration, and server controls, but I don't know why so many things are unworkable after small tweaks, and I really don't understand why differences between versions of Python (not just 2 and 3, but builds of each), operating systems (including versions of each) and frameworks have such different commands. Every how-to guide I have seen has not been quite right on my system, so I have to tweak each of the commands to fit into my environment until I find something that works, and oftentimes I also have to search online for changes in the books because parameters once used for functions now lead to errors! Is that improvement? I have heard that Django is great once everything is running, and I am not going to give up on it yet, but I am spending hours just figuring out little tasks that I have all the documentation for, even the scripts for, but whose requirements have changed since print. I question the complexity. My task here is to learn Python, not any particular framework, so if Django continues to take so much time, I will try another framework for my project. I want to get it moving and the things I am spending time on are too small to spend days working through.

### R1D61

Today's Progress**: I learned more about np.arange() which returns evenly spaced values within a given interval, np.zeros() which returns an array of zeros as specified in the parentheses, and plt.quiver() which I now half-understand but need to explore further in order to get my arrows on this chart looking clean. The best thing I learned, since I do want to do some graphic design with my new skill, is the RGBA tool to specify opacity. While definitely not the quickest way, I simply opened a PowerPoint palette, found the numbers, and googled the hex values. I'd like to find a way to specify transparency without using hex, but I want to get better at using hex anyways. I know how to calculate it, but not quickly.  

Thoughts: I had another busy day at work but I did manage to squeeze in a few hours here and there throughout the day. I'm glad that I will get a reasonable amount of sleep tonight, and still feel like I accomplished something.

### R1D62

Today's Progress**: I got a fairly acceptable visual representation of the AI sphere model today, working with both ax.quiver(x,y,z,dir1,dir2,dir3) and ax.scatter(x,y,z,color). I am happy with it for now, although it is not interactive based on the cube-that will simply take some geometric calculations. There is actually a lot I can do with the using random collision points, but I will wait until I get the paper written explaining the theory a little better. 

Thoughts: My lesson learned today was to know and understand the x, y, z coordinate system-I was mixing the three coordinated up because I thought that y was still the vertical axis but in this case that is z. I do like the challenge doing visualizations, though, and although today's work seemed small, it will help me in the future.

### R1D63

Today's Progress**: I encountered a few errors today as I reworked my admin page. I made some goals in the proper model once I built it. I was trying to give a 'text' attribute a different name-that didn't work so well. I also missed an indent and completely threw off the program. I learned about using the python manage.py shell program for diagnostics, which I think is a very valuable tool so far. 

Thoughts: Although I have not really sat down and worked too much with Github, I have used it a lot by this time and I know my repository is pretty much butchered up. I do need to organize it soon, as I move forward with my code base.

### R1D64

Today's Progress**: My project is off the ground now. This weekend I want to think over the time required to do what I want to do and get a realistic timeline for the project. Luckily I was able to pull some old PHP files that I though were lost from an external hard drive. It's nice to know that they are still there. They aren't beautiful, but some of the content I definitely want to keep. As far as Python goes, I learned still a lot more about dependencies, folders, directories, and such. I learned that the Django database is just an interface to the actual database. I learned that a Foreign Key represents a one-to-many relationship. I learned that URLs map to a view. I learned that ' . ' on an import means ' same directory '. I even learned about the render() function to pull requests from the index.html homepage. I learned a lot today. 

Thoughts: I feel great that I learned all I did. For a while I was not able to write a lot of code while I was learning the virtual environment and migrations but now that I am rolling I can use some of my existing assets to make something nice. I don't want to plan too much-I want to take this as it comes, get a few users, and use the "tracer bullet" approach to improve my app. I am really in no hurry at this time, but I would like to finish before my first 100 Days of Code round. (I think there will be a second!)

### R1D65

Today's Progress**: I fixed my first link that I was having so many problems with yesterday-there were a few dependencies in my python files that I was not correctly updating and I also needed to add a base.html page to define redundant data so as to avoid redoing every page. The link problem was solved by removing the '.html' from my new django link from my old PHP homepage. This generated a No Reverse Match error; I don't think that the Traceback was specific enough for something so specific, but nevertheless, I know Django is an important skillset to have and now problems are taking less time to fix than they did before. I can only hope this trend continues!

Thoughts: I am not experiencing the magic of Django yet, since I am really just translating over some old WAMP PHP files to fit into the framework, but in my reading I am starting to see where Python and Django will make my back engine more effective. I can't wait until I can experience that. Tomorrow I have to fix dozens of links and do some entry into my Django application files. This will likely be a muscle memory day, getting quicker and more efficient at old stuff, than actually learning new functions, etc.
