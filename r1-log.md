# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 18, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: I learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. As I move through the 100 Days of Code challenge, I plan to refactor all or most of my code every 20-30 days. That way, I can: 1. revisit topics that I might not be clear on, and 2. use what I have learned to improve upon the code. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the one of the world's most favored languages. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in. I plan to do Twitter videos, each around a minute long, for people to watch. Today's video was a bit amateurish, since I was holding the camera (an iPhone) while I was flipping through the program.

### R1D2

Today's Progress**: Today I learned how to use .append() function, which will add an element to the end of a list, the import directive, which is used to bring in modules, and negative index numbers in a list, which can be used to reference indexes starting from the end of the list (index -1), rather than the beginning. Today's topic, "About Python", I intended to take a deeper dive into how and where Python is used, while learning some basic functions as well. With the "import this" directive, the console loads "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, a prose relating to the mission of the Python language. At the end of the program, I import "antigravity", which loads a browser and takes us to a Python comic site. 

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive. With a basic understanding of computer programming, I should only need to look things up one time. While Python is very new to me, many methods are similar to other languages. The audio quality was still low, as the the recording program used would not record more than one screen-making it difficult to record the code and what it is actually doing. I know I need to work on this. Today I made two recordings: one as a response to the original tweet.

### R1D3
Today's Progress**: I made my first successful while loop in Python using the Fibonacci sequence and based on user input. I also learned my way aroung Github a little better. While loops seem to be used more often in Python than in other languages. I do know that they tend to use less memory. As time goes by I will learn more about why Python users tend to write while loops more often (if that is indeed the case). I think that due to the nature of Python (being interpreted after compiling as opposed to strictly compiled like C++ or C#) users have to find ways to conserve memory. Python is known to be a slower language. 

Thoughts**: Even though for loops are in many cases superior to while loops, the programs I have written for C++ and C# always used for loops so I haven't really used while loops much at all. As a beginner in Python I figured I would start learning the right way and use one to do a Fibonacci sequence, which I found a bit tricky at first. I learned the value of stepping away from the machine for a few minutes and coming back. I am not happy with the video presentation on Twitter, as the tweet was in two pieces, and my video and audio quality are still pretty bad. I am, however, happy with my progress in Python for the day.

### R1D4
Today's Progress**: Today I used a lot of new methods, including pop(), insert(), str(), max(), min(), stdev(), variance(), and mean(). I learned that I need to import the statistics module if I want to use certain methods. I created random numbers within a loop (my first Python for loop). I first used ctrl+y to undo a previous edit. Tomorrow I want to study more about definite vs. indefinite iterations. I do know that a for loop represents a definite iteration, while a while loop represents an indefinite iteration. 

Thoughts: I learned a lot today but I felt that it came quicker than before. I feel my journey is well underway now. I had some problems first importing the statistics module; it didn't seem as if I had that module at first but upon the second try, the auto-complete/intellisense kicked in and I knew at that moment that it was there. Everything worked from that point on. This is the second day that I ran into some roadblocks trying to do what I wanted to do. I realize that harder times are ahead but I also know that is the only way to really learn something. I am still recording videos with my phone, and they are not good quality. I am happy to have correctly used a for loop today.

### R1D5
Today's Progress**: Today I solved the Towers of Hanoi problem, which proves that the amount of "1"'s in the binary code for the minimum amount of moves to shift a stack of increasing size disks to another stack without ever putting a bigger disk onto a smaller one, given three towers, is equal to the amount of disks in the stack. I did not know this when I set out to solve the problem, as I based the problem on the Python "MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming" lectures I have watched by Eric Grimson and John Guttag. I want to learn later why this is true. I find problems using binary code to be interesting because they are quite simple but elusive. I used pow() to raise a number to a power and bin() to convert an output variable to binary code. I also used another while loop today, creating an 'infinite loop' so that a user may input data as many times as needed to test the algorithm. 

Thoughts: Today, on Day 5, I finally felt like I can turn on the editor and start to write a simple program that makes some sense without having to look everything up. It is helping me to write things out on paper using a diagram or pseudocode before I just start typing. I think that is the key to writing efficient code. I really do, however, feel that it takes too long to crank out certain pieces of simple code, such as today's while loop. While I can type it quickly, sometimes putting a math problem into Python language proves to be something I have to look up. I am hoping to speed up soon. I still am producing crude videos on twitter but am going to try using a new app tomorrow to record video internally, while making multiple apps visible.

### R1D6
Today's Progress**: I learned about the sort() and sort(reverse=True) method, what the error message EOF means, ways to sanitize user input, and combining 'or' operators (in fact, I hadn't used an or operator in Python before-I was trying to type ||). I learned about the elif() statement but I didn't actually use it for my program, as I need to drill down deeper into the logic. I made ASCII art in the console, and even that was a bit of a challenge because I learned that I need to cut off the quotation marks right after the last character of input. All-in-all, I worked all day learning Python. Luckily, I am a teacher and am on summer holiday with the school system I work for, so I have time. 

Thoughts: Today was the most challenging so far. I really wanted to get the Monty Hall problem complete, but also wanted to sanitize user input and make a little bit of ASCII art at the top illustrating each of the three doors. The real challenge came at the end. After repeated testing, I knew that my probabilities were not coming out right. Continued manipulation of the if-else statements at the end finally gave me statistically accurate results. I also dealt with some hardware issues when I had a mouse freeze up. I found a good video editor but then I was having difficulty converting the .AVI file to .MOV or .MP4. Then I was able to convert but not able to upload to twitter. I finally got that problem solved as well but the public video will only play on an iPhone but not Windows10. I will add that issue to my to-do list for catch-up stuff. I learned more today than any other day and the reason I got caught up so many times was because I am pushing myself hard. I refuse to copy any other code, but insist on figuring out problems on my own. It's nice to finally get something right after hours of work on it.

### R1D7

Today's Progress**: Today I used append() to put user data into a list (as the last element), len() to create a variable for the length of that string, and ' ,'.join() to remove the quotes from the string when using the data in a readable format (as output).  

Thoughts: I am getting in the flow. Things are taking less time, and I am starting to visualize how to create basic structures in Python, i.e. get it to do what I want it to do. First I wanted to put user inputs from a SWOT Analysis into a dictionary, but I decided that a list would make more sense, since I had no need for key-value pairs. However, I do understand that a much larger program could use a dictionary to decipher the inputs. I will consider this in the future. My streams are looking better when I record them. I quite often wonder if the stuff I am doing will be considered best practice or bad practice as I move along with this challenge. I am already looking at pieces of code from my first days and seeing quicker ways to do it. My audio is sounding better with the Bandicam recorder.

## R1D8

Today's Progress**: Today I configured some settings in IDLE and learned how to make a dictionary, as well as a dictionary within a dictionary. I used these tools to make a console app, this one explaining the planets in the solar system. 

Thoughts: Today I talked about the planets of the solar system. I think that I can do a lot of interesting things with Python and for the 100 Days of Code challenge I want to do things that I am interested in. The string at the bottom of the program (which is really the main part of the program) took some time. Getting the output to display only the values took a while to figure out. I did get it to work, but I am not sure if it was the most efficient way. I want to start testing runtime using different methods so that I will be ready when I get outside the console apps and begin the work on my first project in Python, which will probably use the Django framework.

### R1D9
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little bit about ways to sort through lists. I learned about the Bubble Sort, the Merge Sort, the Quick Sort, the Selection Sort, and the Heap Sort. I learned how to activate the sleep function with seconds as a parameter to slow a program down so that a user may read or examine contents of a console application. I wrote my first function in Python, using the def command. I learned about the range function. While I knew the range could normally assign the amount of iterations in a for loop with two parameters (e.g. range(1,20); start at 1 and stop at 16) what I did not know was that the range function can be defined with one parameter (e.g. range(16)) meaning count from 0 to 16 (stop at 16), and can be defined with three parameters (e.g. range(19,0,-1)), meaning, in this case, that the program is to count down -1(step)) from 19(start) to 0(stop). 

Thoughts**: I originally planned to do all five sorts in one program, but since these methods are new to me in the Python environment, I soon discovered that while it would be possible, I would be cramming too much data into one day. While the bubble sort might not be the most useful tool, it seems to be taught as the gateway to more useful (and complex) methods of sorting. I had some difficulty figuring out the logic when writing the code for the bubble sort, and I do plan to give it further study tonight and tomorrow because the Merge sort is more complex. For the five programs I would like to add on a sort of function that returns runtime and memory usage for each process (and other processes as well). As I approach Day 10, I plan to work on writing better code for familiar topics, while increasing related skills such as commenting code, appropriately naming variables, using hardware and software efficiently, knowing Windows hot keys to speed up my work, testing and speaking better during my presentations, and testing I/O across various apps, browsers, and operating systems. Today was the first day that I really felt challenged, but I know that in order to learn, I must do things that present a challenge.

### R1D10
Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the Merge Sort. The Merge Sort is very efficient and is in common usage. It is considered a "divide and conquer" algorithm because it works by splitting the list in half multiple times. It is a bit complex to code at my level and seems to use a lot of memory for large data sets. I only used 10 numbers in this set. It is a quick algorithm, meaning it runs quickly through the processor. I find it interesting to learn about the two main complexities: memory and runtime as the list increases (another one is time to code it from scratch). With all code generally available, time to code is next to irrelevent, and with today's computing power, memory usage in normal amounts would be nominal. So this explains why when working with big data, one would generally use the more complex algorithms-even though they are harder to code and use a lot of memory, these two negatives are many times outweighed by the fact that they are fast and increase at a slower rate when more data is examined. 

Thoughts**: I learned some basics today, including the "//" operator in Python 3, which, like the "/" operator in Python 2, simply returns an integer value, even if the expression has a remainder. I learned how to find a line in IDLE when there is an error by pressing Alt+G. I learned different ways to split the list using split() and using [:x] to find the x from the right of the set. As I begin to deal with data analysis, I want to learn about Big O notation, which describes the complexities of different processes, like sorts and searches.

### R1D11
Today's Progress**: Today I streamlined a lot of my existing skills, streamlining a user-input for loop to create random variables, this time without naming each variable after an if statement. I learned the theory behind the quicksort, but didn't complete it yet. I plan to begin work on it again tomorrow. I learned better ways to use the 'i' counting variable within a for loop or while loop for indexing variables. All-in-all, I learned a lot.   

Thoughts**: I worked late because I wanted to finish the Quick Sort. Tonight when I sleep on it I think I will give me new ideas for tomorrow. I did, however, learn exactly how it worked, so while I feel that I can explain it fairly thoroughly, putting it into code proved to be a big challenge. That is okay, because I am at my best when I am over my head in new information. I still have four more days of holiday until I return to full-time work so I am obviously pushing myself to learn all I can before I have a shortage of time. I originally had planned to have a completed piece of code each day of the 100 Days of Code challenge, but I can see now that sometimes this will be difficult. During the second half of the challenge, I do plan to work on a large project (a website) so I know at that time at least, that I will not have new completed work every day, but rather pieces of code to submit. I guess I should get used to it.

### R1D12
Today's Progress**:Today I learned some good coding habits, including using the print() statement a lot, then commenting it out when I figure out if the snippet of code is working. I learned about the return statement, in that it can be used independently to end the execution of a method, or to return a value. (If a function has no return, then that function returns None.) I learned about index values, and collisions. In fact, I believe that is my problem right now with this program. I also learned how to separate a list (e.g. by < or >). This will prove a valuable skill as I continue to learn Python.    

Thoughts**: I feel extremely disappointed by my lack of progress, even though I did learn a lot. I worked all day and night trying to figure out how to get the code for this quick sort to work on my own. I don't just want to copy and paste large pieces of code-I want to spend the time learning it, making it, breaking it, and seeing my mistakes so that I can become a better programmer. While I probably learned more today than any other day, I am not happy with my progress because I still do not have a workable program. I will continue again tomorrow!

Link to work: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/12_QuickSort2.py]

### R1D13

Today's Progress**: I learned a valuable script for creating random numbers with x = random.sample(range(a,b),y). I learned the meaning of partitioning, which, in this context, means to split a list into parts based on some criteria, such as a pivot value. I learned a drawback when coding recursive algorithms, such as the Quick Sort, which is that if there are indexing conflicts it can cause a stack overflow. I polished my skills in boolean user-defined preferences by asking the user if he/she would like to assign random variables or use a predefined set. So, my array was already defined, but if the user wants, he/she could change it. I also learned a convenient way to create multiple arrays in one line, with the script a,b,c = [][][]. By watching a few videos on the subject, I learned that there are multiple ways to conduct something like a Quick Sort. Some people use the last element in the set as the pivot point and others start with a random element. In thinking about it, it seems that either is just fine for a normally distributed set. 

Thoughts**: I feel good that I finally finished the Quick Sort. I learned that there are many different ways to do it, and that the way I was attempting in D11 and D12 was more difficult. I made a ton of mistakes today too though. Soon I want to research Big O notation to really understand how and why each of these sort methods are better at different times. I am sure that many complex algorithms examine the dataset first then use whichever set is most efficient. I would like to perhaps build a project on this in the future.

### R1D14

Today's Progress**: I used some new testing methods today, considering the algorithm I was working on involved iterations. I learned the theory of it, but want to explore the various ways that (it seems) one can compute it. It appears that the algorithm can be computed by selecting max values or min values, and can also involve splitting the data into two arrays, or simply popping and appending the existing array.  

Thoughts**: I worked on this in the morning and at night. I had a large errand to run across town and didn't get as much progress as I would have liked. I do feel that things are coming to me more quickly now. Tomorrow I plan to learn the Heap Sort, which I think is very complex. Tomorrow is the day that I go back to teaching (we have been on summer holiday in my school system) so I am going to do my best to finish the Heap Sort with any spare time that I have. As tiring as it can be, learning to code in earnest feels like opening myself up to a whole other world.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

### R1D15 
Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a Heap Sort. It is a fairly efficient sorting algorithm. Memory usage when using it is low, the time to code it is minimal, and it is consistently fast, though at times not as fast as the Quick Sort. Actually, while I was learning about the Heap Sort, I learned a lot about indexing and visualizing a list as a heap, or binary tree. I also learned about the math.log2() function, which is very helpful when dealing with decision science. I do not know whether or not I will incorporate this function into the final version of my Heap Sort algorithm. I also learned more about recursion, why it is important, and why calling functions within functions illustrates it. 

Thoughts: Learning about something first before attempting to code it has major advantages. Today I learned to visualize nodes in an array form. While simplistic, it is a new way to look at things for me. As a side note, understanding recursion will make me a better investor, since I do incorporate algorithmic trading into my strategies. Being able to think about things in a less linear fashion will certainly make me less dependent on other's formulas and more able to develop my own indicators on more than just simple chart patterns. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/15_HeapSort.py]

### R1D16

Today's Progress**: Today I learned the uses of the floor() function (to remove the decimal portion of a number and convert it to the lower integer. It has its uses in the binomial tree when we are trying to index the parent node of the child, where the left side (2i) and the right side (2i+1) have the same parent. I also improved on translating pseudocode or code from other languages like C++ or C# into operable Python structures. I encountered the recursion error and found a way supposedly to cure it using the sys module but I didn't find it much value for my actual need so I deleted it-my error was still there and there wasn't much this fix would improve. I know it's there when or if I need it again but I didn't see a need to explore it any further. I learned the famous heapify() method and I wonder why that is not in the standard Python library since it seems to common and standard for this sorting method. 

Thoughts: As I stated on twitter several days ago, one of the things I have noticed so far about Python is that some activities that appear difficult are very simple to accomplish but some things seem simple but in reality are very complex. As I learn the syntax, I continue to struggle with indexing errors and adjusting the entire program so that they are corrected accordingly. I find some things to be unnecessarily complicated but I think that I am still trying to use C-like syntax for many tasks. I think once I start to experiment with the frameworks and libraries I will become more used to Python.

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/16_HeapSort.py]

### R1D17

Today's Progress**: Today I simply made a console application to compute binary and hexadecimal numbers. I used the standard python functions of bin() and hex(), then wrote custom functions to computer the numbers as we would manually on paper. I also practiced doing min() and max() functions on a set of numbers

Thoughts: Today I had to teach in two different parts of town and in the morning had to plan for the lessons for about two hours. I got home pretty late. So I wanted to do one of the lighter programs that I had planned. Using bin() and hex() turned out to be simpler than I thought so I decided to show the division by base method to show each step when manually representing numbers in base 2 and base 16 formats formats. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/17_BinaryandHex.py]

### R1D18

Today's Progress**: today I started on writing my own binary search function after practicing some other coding that I thought might be useful towards today's work but turned out not to be. I did learn about simplifying code using the list comprehensions, the sum() function to add up all elements of a string, the list() function to wrap a range into string format, and about avoiding an obscure error dealing with a name of one of my other files in my working directory (numbers.py). So I learned a lot. 

Thoughts: I didn't finish what I wanted to however. I really felt like I was prepared to tackle the binary search and the work started off well. Soon I ran into conflicts when I attempted to make my custom function recursive. I reworked it, trying to make it iterative, then I realized something else, that was fairly obvious. This should not simply be searching for a number that you know is there-there needs to be a boolean switch to determine if the number is actually in the list. All-in-all, that gives me two problems to work on tomorrow. As is usually the case, on the day that I feel like I got little done, I actually learned a lot. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/18_BinarySearch.py]

### R1D19

Today's Progress**: Today I redid most of my binary search program and got it working. I learned a lesson about naming variables exactly. Somehow, variables that are not named exactly just don't seem to fall in place, even though you think you know what they are meant to represent. I learned about returning a non-familiar object when a failure or error is encountered, such as -1 for a method that should under normal circumstances, return a zero or positive integer. I learned about the NoneType error, and that when I see it, it must mean that what I am looking for is not being returned correctly. 

Thoughts: I didn't think my binary search idea would take too long, with some idea of iterative and recursive sequencing in my mind now on the 19th day. However, refusing to just copy and paste, I worked through it for hours figuring out why each thing was the way it was and did what it did. The end result was a working binary search method. While it uses a simple array of one-off numbers (1-10 for indexes of 0-9), it could easily be scaled up. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/19_BinarySearchPart2.py]

### R1D20

Today's Progress**: Today I learned to work with a list within a list, learned all about recursive functions in Python, including base case and recursive case using if/else and calling global variables within a function, dealing with dictionaries vs. lists, and even a little about business planning in Python (at a simplified and theoretical level).

Thoughts: I started off wanting to learn more about recursive functions. I was sitting at a coffee shop looking over some simple examples, and thought about making a simplified profit example based on total purchases in a typical evening. Soon I was putting in some sales numbers for receipts, with each array within the dictionary being equal to one hour's sales. Since C# is my first language, it came natural to write an iterative function and I figured that I would leave that in, just to do the calculation both ways. I learned that in python, a dictionary value can only be listed once within an array, so what I originally planned to do as a dictionary turned into a list. Then I spent the remainder of the afternoon before my teaching appointment writing out basics for the recursive part of the program. As usual, I hit a few snags but I am up late again, finishing up this program. I will be tired tomorrow, but it is worth it, because today I really starting feeling natural at writing functions and even wrote my first recursive function without having to get any help from examples on the internet. I am pretty proud of that.

### R1D21

Today's Progress**: I learned today how to better utilize multiple operations and functions within a method. I also learned to import and execute sound files to the application (.wav), using the correct format and file structure. This console application actually creates tap codes from input. In the future, I will fix it to do sentences. 

Thoughts: It is pretty obvious to me that this could be achieved with far fewer lines of code using a two-dimensional array. However, today, as well as yesterday, I hit no major roadblocks and that is a new experience. On Day 21 I feel like I am about ready to start working with real data and in a User Interface environment. In the next few days, I want to go over all my "to-dos" from Days 1 - ??? and also redo some of the coding from those days. If I keep making progress, today's app may be one of the ones that are redone. I see now that yesterday I really had an "ah-ha" moment when I began defining functions and calling them recursively. Today I defined two functions and nested one inside the other. I am making progress on this, but I know that I have just begun. I still feel like a Python beginner, but I definitely feel 21 days into it!]

### R1D22

Today's Progress**: Today I dealt with a "'list' object is not callable" error. It triggered because I was trying to use a list name as a function (the function and the array have similar names). I also learned that longer or complex programs should use "return None" values within functions for cleaner code. I learned how to set the Python environment variable in order to manipulate the program with the command prompt, then run pip to initiate and download modules. Finally, I started my first Github pull request. While the three main things I made the program do work as typed with no errors, I want to spend more time with them to see if I can make more use of them. My original idea is to view time to run, time to code, and total memory usage of the program for when I refactor my old word from the first days of this challenge. 

Thoughts: As usual, I learned the most when I was completely mixed up. I could not get the Python environment variable to initiate, despite leading it directly to the correct file path. I tried putting the semicolon in various places and typing different strings that I saw demonstrated on the internet (I had the same problem with Visual C#), but then I finally just went to install Python and chose "Modify" and checked the box to create the environment variable. My code is not doing exactly what I wanted it to do but it's doing what it's supposed to do. (The time.time() function is only measuring down to the tenth of a second, the memory function is returning a hexidecimal value, and the memory usage function I believe is giving information for my system, not the specific program. But it is good to know these tools and it was good to get caught up on the basics of finding modules and using them, because soon I will be doing data visualizations, so I need to be a little more fluent in system processes. I feel good about today's work. In one more week I will be working at my day job a lot more (the kids at the school I work are coming back from their summer break) so I need to be getting the "blocks" out now so that I can flow when I have less time in the evenings.

### R1D23

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the Python array arr.array(''[]), the list [], the dictionary, or associative array {}, and the tuple (). I have been using lists and dictionaries fairly extensively for the first 20 days of this challenge, and have referred to both of them as arrays, but today I learned about what is known as the Python array. I designed a simple miles per hour to kilometers per hour program that first defines two lists, then turns them to tuples, then manipulates the tuples. It is not anything spectacular, but it is another first because it is the first time specifically working with a tuple, at least working with what I knew was a tuple. I learned about the immutable nature of tuples, that this can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage, and the possible use-cases for tuples, one of which includes graphing environments. I did know that tuples are used often in QuantConnect discussions and in trading environments in general, but up to this point didn't know why. Now I feel that I am closer to understanding that. Since data-science is my objective on this challenge, I feel that I might be using the tuple more often in the future. 

Thoughts: I started out wanting to learn about the tuple, but also learned about the Python array as well. Up until now, I had been referring to lists as arrays, which I believe is correct, but not specific, since there is an actual array module and definition which include C-like type codes. Both the array and the tuple warrant further study, but I am happy with today's progress. As far as Python goes, I do wonder why for a language that seems to be built for simplicity, there are so many seemingly intentional complexities. Yesterday I was left wondering why the psutil module required a .whf extension vs. standard exe. as in the past. I also keep running into standard library methods in Python 2 that have been deprecated for Python 3. I wonder why there are so many differences or why old methods can't just stay possible without having to user-define them. I still am convinced that once I move beyond this "Hello World" stage, I will see why Python is rapidly becoming one of the world's most favored languages. Since I've had my run with a few C-likes languages, as well as html, CSS, PHP, and a little javascript, I will stick with Python for this 100 days of code challenge because I do want to become good at it, but whether or not it becomes my language of choice I do not know yet.

### R1D24

Today's Progress**: Today I cleaned up some of the old code that I wrote in the first days of the challenge and added to some of the newer code. I learned a lot about making methods from existing programs, and ran into a few new errors along the way, including a seemingly meaningless indention error and a problem with one of the programs which was using the global directive inside a nested function and would no longer work when made into a function itself. I fixed this by making that global variable local and changing the order of the parameters. 

Thoughts: As usual, I learned a lot. I added to my tap code program but now as it is it is in a perpetual loop (I'm fixing it to do sentences.) I learn the most when I have to figure out workarounds, and I did two of those today (as stated above).

### R1D25

Today's Progress**: Today I extracted and imported matplotlib for use in my application. I learned a new useful Python function, quit(), that can be used to get back to the standard command prompt when running Python from the command line. Moreover, I learned a lot about the Matplotlib package for Python, including basic functions used to create a line chart, bar chart, histogram, and scatter plot.  

Thoughts: I really like getting outside the console environment and into statistics and data visualization. I did not run into any major difficulties at all today. While I feel like I hit a major milestone, the fact that I had no problems with this tells me that I need to push myself a bit harder. After having to re-download and modify Python the other day when not being able to start pip from the command line to get psutil, it certainly was welcome to easily type pip install matplotlib and have everything work. I find the Matplotlib module to be very user-friendly and look forward to using it for a while in the next days of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

### R1D26

Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work with a line chart in the Matplotlib module. I saw today as an opportunity to learn move about Big O notation, and I wrote functions to generate a y output list using constant, logarithmic, linear, quadratic, and exponential time complexity. While I understand the theory, I will have to see more examples of code to solidify my understanding of what is what. I understand that the binary search is logarithmic, double loops are quadratic, and that most good algorithms fall in the n log n region.

Thoughts: Today I started to see the value of not just writing code, but writing clean and efficient code. While thinking about it, I theorized that most popular websites and applications tend to favor complex but streamlined code on the backend, to affect quick and relevant search results, and simple code on the frontend, so that most of the public can adequately use the product and get a job done, without having to navigate through a pretty but complex user interface. This helps to explain why the Big O Notation is important to understand for anyone striving for a good user experience, where users come to a site for speed and relevancy, not necessarily beauty.

### R1D27

Today's Progress**: Today I started building a supply and demand chart from Matplotlib. I found and imported cv for photos and was able to put a photo in the background of the graph. I used plt.figure(figsize=()), plt.annotate(), and plt.xkcd(). I also better visualized and implemented a linear relationship between the supply line and the demand line using a -num relationship in a for loop. 

Thoughts: Right now I really just want to clean up this graph. I need to get the resolution right on my graph, since I don't want to stretch the photo. I also need to figure out why when the image is inserted, the y-axis inverts, and figure out how to insert a little dotted line pointing to the intersection. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/27_SupplyandDemandPt1.py]

### R1D28

Today's Progress**: I finished a fairly simplistic supply and demand chart. I learned a lot, including a couple visual enhancements to the chart. I learned to invert the y-axis and used it as a workaround when inserting my image caused the y-axis to flip. I ended up having to go back to my image editor, flip the image, and turn it inside out so that it would fit this image. I also learned how to format a string using the '$' but wasn't able to use it to much effect on this graph. 

Thoughts: As planned, I am just about to go back to full-time days as a schoolteacher, so it looks like I will have gotten a good 30 days in before things get intense. I am happy to have made it this far but I know that things will get much more intense when I add 3-5 hours of teaching onto my morning schedule. I am prepared for the challenge but I know it will be difficult at times. 
Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/28_SupplyandDemand.py]

### R1D29

Today's Progress**: Today I learned a few more things about basic data visualization in Matplotlib, mainly basic visual enhancements to the histogram and the pie chart. I dealt with a Name Error: 'subplot' is not defined, and I dealt with it by importing pylab into the code. I also learned the pass keyword to leave a class empty in order to work on it later. 

Thoughts: I planned to get around 5 days on matplotlib visualizations then begin to work with the Pandas module. While I have been creating lists on my own, now I want to start importing the data from Excel spreadsheets. Tomorrow I will start on Pandas. Probably by Day 40 or before I plan to work on some of my past stuff and perhaps attach spreadsheets or more. I love this because I learn as I go. I feel I have come a long way in the last 29 days.

### R1D30

Today's Progress**: I was happy to make something more out of the work that I started on Day 4. I learned how to create a csv file as an export. Tomorrow I will work on importing the data. I learned about the concept of dependency with regard to files needed to make a program work. It is often the problem I have when I look at others' code on Github or anywhere else. If I can figure out more about dependencies: what to look for and where to put it together, I will be able to work with others' code better than I have in the past. This is where learning this from the ground up comes into play. I did learn the DataFrame method today and it worked on the first or second try. I plan to spend some time getting to know the Pandas module. 

Thoughts: I am happy to have made it to Day 30. I worked a long time today on a variant of this problem but was not able to make it work. I certainly have my to-do list ahead. I figured out how to make a dictionary out of a loop but have not been able to pass it to output via the Matplotlib and Pandas. I also need to figure out more about the 'Value Error: If using scalar values you must pass an index' error. I also need to look back to prior days and see all of the things that I have had problems with and figure them out now before I start to move along.

### R1D31

Today's Progress**: I worked with Jupyter notebook again but could not get it to do basic things like importing data. I will return to it tomorrow. Earlier today I did familiarize myself with the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python. I will put these principles into practice as I learn and create with Python. I did learn the .head(), .tail(), and .loc[''] functions. I also learned importing with .read.csv(''). 

Thoughts: I didn't get done as much as I would of liked. I spent a long time messing with Jupyter Notebook but I was not able to get it to do what I wanted. I will learn it. I may have to configure something-I am not sure. I did learn a little about JSON and plenty of new Python methods (see above). 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/31_PokemonSpreadsheet.py]

### R1D32

Today's Progress**: Today I looked back at a few of the things that I have intended to catch-up on. I solidified my understanding of definite vs. indefinite iteration. In a definite iteration, the terminal value of an iterator is known and the program repeats until that number is reached. An example of this is a for loop. A for loop specifies the amount of times the program will iterate. In an indefinite iteration, the program repeats until a value is true. An example of this is a while loop. The function does not know how long it will have to iterate, it only knows when it has reached the value, which is when it stops. I also finally learned how to navigate the Jupyter notebook. It seems I was saving as .py right in the beginning. By leaving the file open and letting the Notebook auto-save, I was able to see the .ipynb extension. I learned a few new methods and tools in Python, including .info() to get metadata about the dataframe, .shape to see the size of it in cells, .drop_duplicates() to get rid of duplicate values, and iloc[:] which warrants further understanding.  

Thoughts: I am glad that after three days I finally got Jupyter Notebook working. I stayed on it because I knew the problem was something small. I do not know if I will continue using it for the duration of 100 Days of Code but I may stick with it during my work in Pandas. At this point I want to get a working understanding of the Pandas module so I may be working with it for a while until I can do basic visualizations with it. Tomorrow I plan to continue my work from today on the coffee shop sales model.

### R1D33

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about calling the data from the spreadsheet by filename.columnnumber. One of the methods that I learned was the type(filename.columnnumber) to find out about the csv data. I also learned to plot a chart using that protocol. I learned about the hlines() function and all of its parameters. It is useful for showing a breakeven point, or, in the case of this graph, closing time when our profits do not exceed a reasonable value. 

Thoughts: The kids at my school come back tomorrow and I am supposed to be working three shifts so that will still give me time to continue this challenge, but I might not have as much time as before. I wanted to get about 30 days in before full-time hours start again and I was able to do that. I really have a good basic understanding of Python and a few of its modules now. Now I will be able to focus, albeit with a little less time on my hands. I've come a long way in a month-learning all about the shell, IDLE, Geany, and Jupyter, learning about while loops, for loops, and if statements, doing sorts and searches, and learning a little about Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. If the next month is half as productive as the last, I will be happy, but I think it will be more. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/33_PythonCoffeeShop.py]

### R1D34
Today's Progress**: I learned about the show_versions() method, as well as some lingo-the octet is 8 bits, or a byte; and a nibble is 4 bits and takes up one hex digit. I learned about memory addresses, which use hexadecimal notation so that they are easier to convert to binary from human eyes (than base 10), but not as long or difficult to figure out as binary. 

Thoughts: Today I got caught up on this. It's new, as I haven't actually done a chart directly from Pandas nor with the dictionay indexing so I figure it will take a while to figure out. I am sure tomorrow it will make perfect sense. 

Link to work:**[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/34_PandasChart_ASEAN.py]

### R1D35

Today's Progress**: While I didn't create the chart purely with a dictionary, which is what I originally wanted, I did get exactly what I wanted by typing the data into a spreadsheet and using read_csv. Today I learned to better use iloc[] to grab a whole column of data for use in plots. I learned how to use the Numpy arange() method, using bottom=last to stack bars, and plt.xticks() to specify the name for each value. 

Thoughts: Learning to quickly change gears and work around a problem is a valuable skillset. Since I am not on a clock I try to work through things as much as I can and then learn the workarounds later. Today, however, I really could not seem to get this plot to work using the dictionary. I know now, based on the last 35 days, that working with dictionaries is a weakness. In the future I will need to incorporate dictionaries into my work so that I will get stronger in using them.

### R1D36

Today's Progress**: I learned how to make a sine wave using the np.sin() method. I learned how to make gridlines on a graph. I also learned how to make a horizontal axis line using axhline(). Finally, I encountered the ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension... and to remedy it I first just tried switching around values to make it at least run. I did get it running, but it makes no sense. Tomorrow and maybe the next day I will spend making something good out of it. 

Thoughts: I didn't get as much done as I would have liked but I believe that this will be an awesome visualization once I get it to make sense. Although it is only an idea really now, I learned a few things today. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/36_RedShiftpt1.py]

### R1D37

Today's Progress**: The main thing I learned today was a workaround. I didn't plan for the red shift / blue shift graph to be complex, I just wanted to make something that was correct, after yesterday's silly graph that didn't say anything really. When I set the wave on this graph using the sin() function I found that it would always be the same (I could be wrong about that but I think sine should always come out the same, shouldn't it?) so I had to work from another angle. I turned up the x-axis values from 10 to 20 and ended up with what I wanted. The problem was that it said 20 at the bottom which meant that red shift and blue shift were at the same frequency: not true. I used plt.axis('off') to turn off the x axis because I didn't need it to illustrate this concept. I think the plots look much better than yesterday's. 

Thoughts: I realize this isn't anything complex but before moving on (as my focus here is an overview of the entire Python language, not just data visualization) I wanted to just map a simple idea out using a chart, but not data intensive. I like this red shift / blue shift chart and my only regret is that it appears that my video might not want to play on browsers operating on a moderately slow speed internet. My video quality needs to improve. I also don't feel like I covered a lot of information today but I did learn the one function and learned some vocabulary about graphics.

### R1D38

Today's Progress**: Today I familiarized myself with kaggle.com for dataset practice and projects. I found a really annoying error that happens for really no reason at all-the unindent does not match error and to cure it I simply had to repaste the entire function-this cleared it up immediately. I used the .describe() stat function to describe the set I am reading from, but did not get everything I hoped for in that set. 

Thoughts: I dont feel like I got much done today, but I tackled a pesky error message, learned about a place to get practice data, and learned a new function. Tomorrow I hope to run this data at least through the bubble sort and the merge sort; maybe all five. 

Link to work**:   [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/38_DataProcessPt1]

### R1D39

Today's Progress**: I didn't make much progress towards a workable program but I worked through a couple snags, learned what would work and what wouldn't, and still ended up not much closer to what I want here. I did learn some housekeeping, such as how  to display file extensions by default on Windows (or Mac). I learned the Python os.getcwd() function for the current directory and os.listdir() for everything in your working directory, in my case a folder by the name python_work. I learned that a CSV has no data type and that is (I think) why I cannot churn the data into a sort function. I learned the word "delimiter" which means any character or group of characters to specify a boundary between separate regions in a datastream, such as "#" for comments. 

Thoughts: I still feel unproductive but all-in-all I did have a productive day at work-even found out that one of my private students got the highest-in-class mark on her test. By the time I got home I was pretty tired and this program still isn't doing what I want but, as usual, by the time I put it away I have learned way more than when things go smooth. When things are rocky, I tend to learn more about why this is, whereas when things are going smooth there is little to be done. I love the challenge. Tomorrow I want to get this working, however. 
Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/39_DataProcessPt2.py]

### R1D40

Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the sort_values() function and a few of it's parameters. I planned to get a Pandas overview during the last few days and I feel I have done this. Today I imported a CSV, manipulated the data, and sent the CSV back out four different ways. I learned about the "Permission Error: [Errno 13] Permission Denied:..." Error, which happens when a file already exists. I also learned the term "in-place sorting," which refers to a sort that simply exchanges values within the list and does not use any additional space for sorting, such as with secondary or tertiary arrays. 

Thoughts: I had to put my idea of running the data through my five sorts on an indefinite hold until I know more about Python processes. I would like to pursue the idea, and perhaps when I come back to refactor all of the code in a week or so I will consider looking over the sort functions again.

### R1D41
Today's Progress**: Today I installed Seaborn using the pip install command line function. I explored several functions to set the style of the plot (sns.set_style()) and to set the type of plot (sns.scatterplot(), etc.). While I knew that Seaborn is built on top of MatplotLib, it didn't dawn on me that I would have to use plt.show() to display the Seaborn visualization. 

Thoughts: I am getting back into the rhythm of this challenge. I just finished my first week of classes of teaching at my school and my body is getting back on schedule. I want to take a good dive into Seaborn for the next five days. I really like the capability of this library. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/41_SeabornIntro.py]

### R1D42

Today's Progress**: Today I combed over some Seaborn built-in datasets. I also looked around in the Python site-packages folder and found where all of the modules are contained. I had been wondering where all of the includes are coming from so now I understand this a little bit better. I learned about unit-testing, the heatmap as a 3-dimensional plot, and about the Index contains duplicate entries error, although I still have not remedied what is causing it. I have work ahead for tomorrow. 
Thoughts: As always, I learned a lot when I was up against a brick wall. I am still up against the brick wall, but I want to think about this as I sleep. Often, I can do better if I return to something in the morning. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/42_SeabornHeatmapPt1]

### R1D43

Today's Progress**: I got the heatmap to work today. In the end, the problem was just the order that I was placing the arguments into the .pivot() function. By reading the standard 'Anscombe' dataset in the order ('dataset', 'y', 'x') I was able to get a logical heatmap plotted. The other error that I overcame was after I attempted to plot a clustermap. Originally (since my objective is to learn Python code and get acquainted with a number of topics-zooming in later) I tried to plot the clustermap to try it out without really seeing or knowing what a clustermap actually was-I was trying to put a string value into the map, which is not accepted. Eventually I just popped the string value out and the clustermap worked fine. 

Thoughts: I think it is good that Seaborn plots do not just accept bad parameters and plot what would really equate to nonsense. As a learner who is not on any hard deadline, it is tempting to get frustrated when something doesn't work but I know in the future the checks and balances that are built-in will be very beneficial to my work. I want to spend a few more of my 100 Days learning more about Seaborn basics and return to this library in the near future. At or around Day 50 I want to get acquainted with Django for some real world projects that I would like to finish, or firmly move towards a finish, by the end of the 100 Days. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/43_SeabornHeatmap.py]

### R1D44

Today's Progress**: Today I moved on learning the Seaborn library with the jointplot. I looked at an available example using variables defined within the actual program but I decided to work further with the 'flights' example dataset, because now I am really starting to grasp how to manipulate this data-a couple days ago I had no idea. I learned about bivariate data, some numpy functions, and the sns.jointplot() with many of the different alternatives (seems that there are many). 

Thoughts: While I don't know if data visualization will be my main focus of Python in the future, it is important to know, and I will be glad to have spent 20+ days on the subject material. As for today, I am putting a star beside the jointplot in my notes because it is something that I definitely want to explore further. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/44_SeabornJointPlot.py]

### R1D45
Today's Progress**: Today I learned the definition of Gaussian distribution: simple really, just a Normal distribution. I did this while I was learning the distplot() function and its application. It is funny how you hear things and never really solidify  what is being said unless you look it up or am working with it. I also learned the boxplot() function. I couldn't get this working the other night but now I have built the knowledge and confidence to work with, I believe, and of the Seaborn plots. 

Thoughts: While I understand how to use most or all of the Seaborn plots now (the coding part) I do not know what all of these terms mean. I want to further my skillsets in data science so that is on the agenda. Luckily, I did study basic statistics, so when I look these up the definitions and interpretation come fairly easy to me. I will work with Seaborn for 2-4 more days (2 more mini-projects) then I spend a session refactoring, commenting, and simplifying all of the code from my Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn work (Days 25-present).

## R1D46
Today's Progress**: Today I worked with lists a bit in some console applications then went back to Seaborn to create a Swarmplot. The Swarmplot, also known as the Beeswarm, does not work too well with big data, mainly because point cannot overlap and are simply stacked on top of each other. Data might not be accurate if there are too many elements. I also learned some information towards my project. On or before Day 50 I plan to learn Django and start doing some web development, using some existing websites and ideas that I have developed in the past and adding a good backend engine so that they are ready to go live soon. I learned why website databases use functions like .lower(), .upper(), and .title() for storage of both usernames and passwords, e.g. data can be sanitized by giving a username a .lower() value than outputing it as .title(). I learned the keywords "in" and "not" and their boolean usage. 

Thoughts: I am enjoying my dive into Seaborn, alongside further study in Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas. While some of my knowledge is indeed memorization as opposed to actual deep understanding, I know that the deep understanding will come as I immerse myself in the Python language. On Day 46, I can say that I am pleased with my progress. Things are certainly starting to make sense now. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/equitymarkets-patch-1/46_SeabornSwarmplot.py]

## R1D47
Today's Progress**: Today I went through all of the basic plots and maps, coding most of them. I really wanted to further my knowledge of Seaborn before I move on (I do plan to return to and/or use this library in the future, and I will be cleaning up all of the code from Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn tomorrow). Tomorrow I will refactor all of my visualization code then move on to familiarizing myself with Django for a while. 

Thoughts: I know that I have barely scratched the surface of Seaborn. I worked on 17 plots and maps today, getting a deeper understanding of the module. I really like Seaborn and think I will find use for it in the future. At first I questioned why some visualizations were coded different from others, but I am starting to see why-for purposes of accuracy, checks are set up so that the user can't just put in any data. My focus for my Seaborn acclimation really was not to work with data, but was to set up the code so that I know the different visualizations in order to work with data in the future. So I used the example datasets and learned how to code the plots, but did not worry too much about what any of it meant. I am going to read through some of the documentation tonight so that tomorrow when I revisit all of my work I will have a better understanding of what is actually taking place in each plot or map.

## R1D48

Today's Progress**: I learned the plt.subplots_adjust() function and most its parameters and the plt.suptitle() function to add a title on top of subplots. I also added hlines() and vlines() with max values on a supply and demand graph with a max value to terminate the lines at an equilibrium. Since I am interested in economics I think I will use this in the future. I still want to make this idea interactive at some point. Most of the stuff I learned today was stuff that I had been putting off as I made new material. What is awesome about this challenge is that things that seemed difficult a few days ago are much easier now!

Thoughts: I guess today was an average day. I worked on cleanly refactoring a few of the days and really cleaned up a few of the mini-projects but also hit a few stumbling blocks-strange that I can't even get the original code from those days to work. Well, tomorrow I have that to work on as well as some other refactors that will probably go by quicker. I am looking forward to cleaning up all of Days 25-47 on one page. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/Refactor/49_Refactor.py]

### R1D49

Today's Progress**: Today I finished wrapping all of Day 25-47 into functions, refactoring some code and improving the functionality of much of it. I learned the tight_layout() function to clean up a figure, the all() built-in function thats returns True if all values are true, and how to fix an unreadable CSV (I cut and pasted the data, created a new Excel workbook, and saved it in CSV format.) That workaround proved successful but I want to experiment with this problem further. 

Thoughts: I don't feel like I accomplished much, although I worked on this for over two hours. Continuously changing small pieces of code and rerunning the program was today's theme. I am glad I got those two programs to work as functions and learned the little CSV problem. I need to try reading Excel docs directly.

### R1D50

Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little about setting up a virtual environment on an operating system (mine is Windows). As usual, I don't feel like I got a lot done but I learned a lot. I learned how to open Powershell from a folder (shift+right click) and work in that folder. In fact, until a kind Twitter user helped me find the Powershell workaround, I was stuck using that standard cmd for the operation and it was getting stuck on something, perhaps a bad path, or multiple paths. I will remember to attempt using the Powershell next time I hit a roadblock. I also learned how to turn permissions on and off and why it can help to overcome errors. 

Thoughts: I stayed up pretty late tonight, but knowing that I have given my all and worked 1-6 hours a day for fifty days now really gave me the movivation to stick with it. I didn't even use any normal Python editor today, although I used Python in the command prompt in and out a few times. I really like the PowerShell workaround. So, as is usual on many days, I spent a long time getting little done, but it is very worth it because now I know things that I didn't know before, and I am using my skills to integrate and streamline an existing website that I hope to take live within a couple months. That's good news!

### R1D51

Today's Progress**: I could not get Django to work correctly today-I had a long day at work and was pretty tired when I came home. I did work on it for a while however, then switched over to something I have been meaning to do-translating some C# code into Python. My AI advancement theory, though incomplete, is something I want to complete during my 100 Days of Code. I will come back to it again when I take another break from the current things I am working on.  

Thoughts**: Although I work full-time, I need to start fitting in some time earlier in the day to code. At night sometimes it is hard to focus. I feel like I can be more productive if I am not working late into the night, then getting up early the next day.

### R1D52
Today's Progress**: The virtual environment is still not flowing well so I worked on finishing the C# translation of my AI program and will return to working on Django this evening. I am getting what is going on but maybe not fully. This type of environment is new to me so once it is working I will be all the better. I hope tonight I can get it going. So far I have learned about the venv CMD command to create a virtual environment, the existance of the wsgi.py file as a web service gateway interface, the cold start problem, and lambda function in Python as small anonymous pieces of code that can take multiple arguments but only have one expression. I dealt with the "Invalid Literal for int with Base 10" Error by commenting out all of the code below the error and working through it line-by-line-solving the problem that was escaping me the other night in several minutes. This illustrates the value of stepping away from the code now and then so as to better analyze a situation. 

Thoughts: Yesterday I worked all day, spent some time with my new baby, and even worked on installing the virtual environment for well over an hour but I didn't have any code to commit so I didn't count the day. I just can't wait to get Django working. After a short break today I will continue working with it. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/52_AIPar2.py]


### R1D53
Today's Progress**: Today I spent hours trying to figure out how to properly finish installing the virtual environment. While there may have been some progress made in my understanding of Windows dependencies and Python in general, I didn't get past PowerShell-I learned some PowerShell commands like mkdir, pip freeze, and run server, but I hardly was able to type much Python code at all. Yes, I learned a lot but it wasn't enough to get this project off the ground. 

Thoughts: I understand that learning any language requires some deep understanding of the operating system you are working on, so for that I am grateful for today. Leaning Powershell is also valuable for this experience, but I do want to get back to working on Python code, as per my goals during this challenge. I am now considering whether I need to be taking the Django route right now. I will keep working on it tomorrow. I need to get some theory in my mind and maybe then I can return to Python, PowerShell, and the Django Virtual environment.

### R1D54

Today's Progress**: Today I spent some time working on the Virtual Environment again. I learned exit() which to my knowledge, functions the same as quit(), to leave Python and get back to the command prompt. I learned the three quotations to leave a long comment in the program. I did figure out the script to create the dependencies, and learned about the activate.bat script and its role in running applications. 

Thoughts: I don't want to get burned out from trying to figure out the exact way to setup a perfect Python environment. If I keep having problems with it I will skip a few things and start to code the project anyways. I have the environment set up but seem to have problems when I run commands like runserver or migrate. I will do what I have to do to keep moving and if something is over my head, I can come back to it when my knowledge of the Python standard library is better. My object here is to code for 100 days, not to do everything perfect every time. If I keep moving I will get better at this. 

Link to work**:[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/54_AIpart3.py]

## R1D55

Today's Progress**: Today I marked a huge milestone: I finished setting up my initial virtual environment and ran commands on it, including startproject, migrate, runserver, and startapp. I don't think I will have problems quite like this again. I now have a much deeper understanding of Windows dependencies. Ironically, managing Windows dependencies around the index.html homepage, subpages, images file, etc. is something my students always have a problem understanding as well. Now that I am starting to set up directories in other environments, maybe I will also find this type of subject easier to teach as well. 

Thoughts: I spent some time today running all of the test to make sure that my app was indeed set up correctly and so far, so good. I'm very happy that such a simple thing is now done. I want to get started building my new website and using the existing assets that I have to start generating some traffic. It is a very exciting time. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/55_VirtualEnvironmentPart2.ps1]

## R1D56

Today's Progress**: Despite learning a lot of theory I didn't type too much Python code today-only some modifications in Models and learning about fields and the "max_length=" classifier. I did run into an error which I eventually fixed: "__init__()
missing one positional argument: "on_delete"". I fixed this by rewriting the topic attribute to have an on_delete parameter. The important thing was that I finally set up the final directory to begin my project. After what seems like an eternity (6 days) the virtual environment, migrations, and app startup are finished and clean and I am now working on the foundation of riceforest.com. So it is an exciting day despite not having much code to show for it. The link to work shows the powershell commands that work on my machine to get as far as I have as per the twitter video. 

Thoughts: Good things happen in different forms. I don't have a load of new code to submit today but my Django project is off the ground! I am very happy that I now understand Windows dependencies a lot better than before-I even redid the project so far so that it will be clean as I move forward (I had one extra folder that I didn't need.) I don't know how long it will take to roll out the riceforest project, but I would like to finish it, and a few other things, by Day 100.

## R1D57

Today's Progress**: My knowledge of hierarchical file structures is growing quickly. Today I even was in a conversation with a coworker about what he thought was slowing down his computer with a new app he was using. I was able to say so much more than just referring to the hard drive space and RAM.  It's amazing how this experience is so relatable to so many things. I never really knew how an app worked, and now I am on the road to developing one. I encountered a couple errors today: one is still occurring but my app is doing what I planned. I will troubleshoot the Powershell error tomorrow. 

Thoughts: I know I am making progress now that I am able to get back into the Python editor and type Python code. But the Powershell experience is helping me too. I want to explore the Models Field page more tomorrow. 

Link to work:**[https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Day_57_CommandShellSolutionPart3.txt]

## R1D58

Today's Progress**: Redoing, breaking, and fixing was the name of the game today. I am making this program work in its early stages, but I keep changing things to see what I can do with my final project as I progress. So far, I have been about to get things back to where they were each time.  

Thoughts: I'm really glad I decided to learn Python, With all the console algorithms in the beginning, the data visualizations in the middle, and the web dev foundations now, I really feel like I am developing a good skillset. Now it is time to start rolling out some productive work. I can't just learn forever, I want to go public with some quality projects. Sometime I work for hours and have very little quality code to submit by the end of my time. Even though I do often learn a lot when this occurs, I don't feel like I got much done in these cases. One big this I did learn is the format of a typical chain, like "from rice_forest.models import Objective", meaning rice_forest is the project, models is the file, and Objective is the class within the file. I guess I knew it was something like that, but to see it in action confirms my speculation. I hadn't really dove deep into the Python theory yet-I generally learn faster by doing stuff like this and learning it in practice. That is why I document all errors and fixes. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/58_ContinuingDjangoInit.py]

### R1D59

Today's Progress**: Today I did a few things. I worked a bit on the riceforest app, I read some documentation on Django Models Field, I worked on annotations in my 3D AI program, I made the visualization more user-oriented (it now changes according to radius inputs), and I made a global variable in the form of float so as to avoid hardcoding every snippet to change the user input back from string. 

Thoughts: I made progress on both projects today but it wasn't much. That is okay though because all of it has to be done. Slower days mean I learn more. If I am always just typing away at code, it means I am probably not doing anything I don't understand, and thereby not learning much. I feel the best thing I learned was working with python manage.py shell to examine data. Once I get better at interpreting the outputs for stuff like this, I will be a better and quicker developer. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/59_AIPart4.py]

### R1D60

Today's Progress**: Today I continued learning Django, then moved on to learning some visualizations in matplotlib and numpy-working for the 5th day on my AI visualization project. I learned about the .gca(projection='3d') function, learned about making 3D cubes in mplot3D, made some arrows, and encountered more than a few errors. I look forward to finishing the AI visualization soon. Actually, the visualization is the small part of this-the written content will require a lot of research. 

Thoughts: I think getting started in Django is unnecessarily complicated. I find it amazing that I will have something working perfectly, go back and tweak one or two things, and find an unworkable program. Then I will just delete the tweaks and find that the damage done to the program is unreparable and I have to go back in and start the entire project over. Now, I guess this is good in the beginning because I am learning a LOT about setting up a virtual environment, migration, and server controls, but I don't know why so many things are unworkable after small tweaks, and I really don't understand why differences between versions of Python (not just 2 and 3, but builds of each), operating systems (including versions of each) and frameworks have such different commands. Every how-to guide I have seen has not been quite right on my system, so I have to tweak each of the commands to fit into my environment until I find something that works, and oftentimes I also have to search online for changes in the books because parameters once used for functions now lead to errors! Is that improvement? I have heard that Django is great once everything is running, and I am not going to give up on it yet, but I am spending hours just figuring out little tasks that I have all the documentation for, even the scripts for, but whose requirements have changed since print. I question the complexity. My task here is to learn Python, not any particular framework, so if Django continues to take so much time, I will try another framework for my project. I want to get it moving and the things I am spending time on are too small to spend days working through. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/60_AIPart5.py]

### R1D61

Today's Progress**: I learned more about np.arange() which returns evenly spaced values within a given interval, np.zeros() which returns an array of zeros as specified in the parentheses, and plt.quiver() which I now half-understand but need to explore further in order to get my arrows on this chart looking clean. The best thing I learned, since I do want to do some graphic design with my new skill, is the RGBA tool to specify opacity. While definitely not the quickest way, I simply opened a PowerPoint palette, found the numbers, and googled the hex values. I'd like to find a way to specify transparency without using hex, but I want to get better at using hex anyways. I know how to calculate it, but not quickly.  

Thoughts: I had another busy day at work but I did manage to squeeze in a few hours here and there throughout the day. I'm glad that I will get a reasonable amount of sleep tonight, and still feel like I accomplished something.  

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/61_AIPart6.py]

### R1D62

Today's Progress**: I got a fairly acceptable visual representation of the AI sphere model today, working with both ax.quiver(x,y,z,dir1,dir2,dir3) and ax.scatter(x,y,z,color). I am happy with it for now, although it is not interactive based on the cube-that will simply take some geometric calculations. There is actually a lot I can do with the using random collision points, but I will wait until I get the paper written explaining the theory a little better. 

Thoughts: My lesson learned today was to know and understand the x, y, z coordinate system-I was mixing the three coordinated up because I thought that y was still the vertical axis but in this case that is z. I do like the challenge doing visualizations, though, and although today's work seemed small, it will help me in the future. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/62_AIParticleCollision(Part7).py]

### R1D63

Today's Progress**: I encountered a few errors today as I reworked my admin page. I made some goals in the proper model once I built it. I was trying to give a 'text' attribute a different name-that didn't work so well. I also missed an indent and completely threw off the program. I learned about using the python manage.py shell program for diagnostics, which I think is a very valuable tool so far. 

Thoughts: Although I have not really sat down and worked too much with Github, I have used it a lot by this time and I know my repository is pretty much butchered up. I do need to organize it soon, as I move forward with my code base.

### R1D64

Today's Progress**: My project is off the ground now. This weekend I want to think over the time required to do what I want to do and get a realistic timeline for the project. Luckily I was able to pull some old PHP files that I though were lost from an external hard drive. It's nice to know that they are still there. They aren't beautiful, but some of the content I definitely want to keep. As far as Python goes, I learned still a lot more about dependencies, folders, directories, and such. I learned that the Django database is just an interface to the actual database. I learned that a Foreign Key represents a one-to-many relationship. I learned that URLs map to a view. I learned that ' . ' on an import means ' same directory '. I even learned about the render() function to pull requests from the index.html homepage. I learned a lot today. 

Thoughts: I feel great that I learned all I did. For a while I was not able to write a lot of code while I was learning the virtual environment and migrations but now that I am rolling I can use some of my existing assets to make something nice. I don't want to plan too much-I want to take this as it comes, get a few users, and use the "tracer bullet" approach to improve my app. I am really in no hurry at this time, but I would like to finish before my first 100 Days of Code round. (I think there will be a second!)  

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/64_ModsandAdditions.py]

### R1D65

Today's Progress**: I fixed my first link that I was having so many problems with yesterday-there were a few dependencies in my python files that I was not correctly updating and I also needed to add a base.html page to define redundant data so as to avoid redoing every page. The link problem was solved by removing the '.html' from my new django link from my old PHP homepage. This generated a No Reverse Match error; I don't think that the Traceback was specific enough for something so specific, but nevertheless, I know Django is an important skillset to have and now problems are taking less time to fix than they did before. I can only hope this trend continues!

Thoughts: I am not experiencing the magic of Django yet, since I am really just translating over some old WAMP PHP files to fit into the framework, but in my reading I am starting to see where Python and Django will make my back engine more effective. I can't wait until I can experience that. Tomorrow I have to fix dozens of links and do some entry into my Django application files. This will likely be a muscle memory day, getting quicker and more efficient at old stuff, than actually learning new functions, etc. 

Link to work**: [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/65_InsertionScripts.html]

### R1D66 
Today's Progress**: My biggest issue today has been getting CSS image links to work in my new Django framework. However, during my first session I was able to quickly manage all my links to adapt to the format needed to work within the Django framework. I got half of what I wanted to done, but I am a lot closer to understanding all of the background files such as views.py, urls.py, and settings.py. I also streamlined my sites with a base.html page so that I do not have to have redundant code in all my html pages. I also defined a rough version of my prototype and a tentative timeline for the project. I actually got a lot done today but I still really want to get those images working. Once again, I am wondering about the complexity of Django and why previous links can't just work the way they did before. (The issue is images on top of hyperlinks-the links work but I am having problems pulling the images from my static file.) I installed Bootstrap via pip for styling but have yet to use it yet. Other than the functional improvements to my page, I learned about the concept of static files. 

Thoughts:  I feel like I am making fast progress now but I know the hard part of this last project is ahead. I want to get the project finished before my first 100 Days of Code ends but I don't want to rush through anything. The solution is going to come through time management, in what is my busiest time of year in the teaching business here in Thailand. Every day I need to make sure that a milestone is completed. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/66_ContinuingRiceForest.py]

### R1D67 
Today's Progress**: Today's milestone, and I feel it was a big one, was simply getting everything to work, via the Django framework, as it was working in WAMP before. Figuring out the dynamic linking system using static images and CSS, and moving my head and title tags out of the base.html file and into the specific menu files made everything look like it did before. (This is, of course, an unfinished site, and Django is going to provide my backengine to get it all running very soon.) 

Thoughts: My goal for the hard-copy prototype is June 27, my sister's birthday, so I am really trying to pinpoint all of the things that will take a long time, require consultation, or take a while to learn and estimate the times on them so that I am ready to move forward as time goes by. I'm still really a beginner in Python, and coding in general, but it may become my first language before the 100 Days is up (I still feel like I understand the inner-workings of C++ better, but then again, I've only been coding in earnest for a little over a year. If not counting BASIC, a language I played with as a child, html was the first thing I did as a profitable venture-an eBay store then later a website. MQL4, a close hybrid of C++ was next, but I only did with it what I needed to code strategies that I had worked out on paper. It wasn't until a year ago that I started really getting serious with MQL4, and I figured C# was a great addition to that because there are better trading engines now than ones that deal strictly with MQL4. I stumbled on Python from a website called Quantconnect where traders discuss C# and Python trading algorithms. So here I am!) Python is going to help me in investing as well as web dev, and this time, unlike many other things before, I am learning it from the bottom up. Every day I am learning more about not only Python, but queries, dependencies, databases, and many other things. I am still a teacher first (even though I do teach web dev to primary students) but I do feel like soon I will be able to call myself a developer, and, for me at least, that's huge.

### R1D68 
Today's Progress**: I made a newbie error in Html/CSS today. I added in a snippet of code and somehow cut off a </div>, causing all of the containers to slip to the bottom. This reinforced the need to always indent properly, as html is not as strict as Python when it comes to indents. I also worked in some of my .py source files trying to add a personal blog to the site to keep up with my goals. I feel like I almost have this, and by tomorrow this should be clearer to me. It shouldn't be a huge priority though, so I will do it after I do some more work on the base files. I learned something about CSS that I should of known, or maybe had forgotten: padding means the space inside the div and margin means the space outside. Just writing this gives me the feeling I won't forget it! I made various Django attribute errors and fixed some of them just by actually reading and understanding the Tracebacks. I am starting to get what they mean, finally!

Thoughts: My goal was to get a drop-down on the front page and I did it. I wanted to get that blog goal page up for my June 27th prototype deadline but right now it is just a white page with a few dead links. Actually, polishing up the goals and timeline are more of a priority than the actual sub-page, so I will be working on those tomorrow. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/68_DropDown.html]

### R1D69 
Today's Progress**: The standard way in Django of defining the URL, writing the view, and writing the template, then making them all work together, while being something I understand, is what I am struggling with putting to practice. A couple weeks ago when I started Django I did a tutorial to make a blog. I am not trying to make a blog similar to that for my 100 Days of Code project, as a sub-page to my new site. While it might not be a business priority for the site to work well, I am still trying to focus most of my time on Python rather than Html, Javascript, and CSS, so I have devoted my time today in trying to make this work so as to further my Python skils (but, yes, also have a stronger foundation for the site's infrastructure). I practiced with URL mapping and encountered a page not found 404 error which I cured by just adding a slash onto the end of the sub-page I was linking to in the URLS.py file. 

Thoughts: Over the last few days I have realized the importance of defining goals in the most possible detail when it comes to coding, because indecision can slow you down over time. The caveat is that once you have a definite build, you can always go back and change it with little effort, given the program foundation (and newfound knowledge) relating to the project. I'm definitely in a small slump here-I just hope it doesn't turn into a big one. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/69_URLS.py]

### R1D70 
Today's Progress**: I learned about plotting a random walk scatterplot and the choice() inbuilt random function for Python, which returns a random number from a list, tuple, or string. I also rendered a world map on a browser from Pygal. Actually getting the render took a few minutes of research (a browser wasn't my first choice) but it seems some of the functionality of Pygal has been deprecated in Python 3.7. I was glad to get the map going. I reviewed importing self-made modules-a simple concept that I am just starting to appreciate the importance of. I learned the difference between the World() black & white function and the SupranationalWorld() function which is in color. 

Thoughts: I know that for myself total immersion into something can lead to burnout. Although I don't have the opportunity to be totally immersed in anything right now, at work I teach web development between 1-4 hours a day so coming home to do it I understand could lead to burnout, which I don't want. I also know Python has a huge universe of resources available so today I did something different. I didn't get a scatterplot done yet, which I want to do, but I found the world map function in Pygal to be awesome, and I see that there is a Django integration for plotting as well so I may end up using this for my project also. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/70_Pygal.py]

### R1D71 
Today's Progress**: I brushed up on some CSS fundamentals today while working on my project, adding in a second main conainer for my homepage, modifying some link colors so that they fit with the background, and learned that I need to reset the server through Django as well as clear my browser history to get a clean link list on localhost (to make sure links, hovers, past clicks, etc. look acceptable against the background).

Thoughts: After finishing my prototype today, I realized just how much work I have ahead of me to really make this thing work by the time 100 Days of Code R1 ends. I need to know more Javascript than I know now. I need work on making widgets, especially a GPS directional component, and I will need to hire someone to write iOS and Android apps IF I like the finished product. July will be a busy month! 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/71_CSSChanges.css]

### R1D72 
Today's Progress**: Today I learned a bit about Javascript, a language I should know but don't. I learned about its back-end functionality, a less-obvious characteristic than its front-end, well-known application. I used a bit of Visual Studio and explored some extensions. I used the Chrome browser via the Inspect>Console web viewer to see Html, CSS, and JS. Finally, I learned how to encrypt data in Python with the SHA256 algorithm after importing hashlib. I didn't get a lot done code-wise, but I put some encrypted 256-bit transactions into a block and learned a whole lot. 

Thoughts: Now is the time in my journey that I am really starting to wish that I had eight hours a day to do coding, rather than nights (I usually work 7 days/week and even though my job does entail teaching some code, I am not doing the things I would like to be doing. When I get home I spend time with my new daughter, which I wouldn't trade for anything, and usually start coding later in the evening.) Seeing the encryption algorithms in Python, looking at some of the Visual Studio extensions, and learning about Javascript makes me want to learn so much that I don't know, and use it as well.  

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/72_Encryption.py]

### R1D73 
Today's Progress**: I learned a few basics of the language, _ to signify a , or a space between 3 zeros in a large number, the help(function) function and, at a higher level, a way to hash a variable. I am happy about what I learned but not necessarily happy with the code I produced.  

Thoughts: Some days I spend many hours working into the night to figure out things I am working on here and to have a presentation on my Twitter videos that makes sense. Today I learned a lot but I don't feel real happy with the final code. But I spent a few hours learning this material. I do, however, want to catch up on my sleep so that I may be more productive in the upcoming days.  

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/73_EncryptionandBlockchain.py]

### R1D74 
Today's Progress**: I learned a lot more about blockchain technology today, mainly the 2^(256-decreasing n) algorithm that causes mining to get harder and harder as Moore's law continues. I also learned a little about classes in Python, particularly the __init__() function inside of a class. I need to watch some videos on class basics in Python though. 

Thoughts: Once again, I wish I would of been able to start earlier than I did so as to feel more sharp. But all I can say is that, for a few hours of work, I am a day ahead of where I was yesterday in understanding both blockchain and the class structure in Python. I am going to print off a paper copy of this blockchain code and study it in my downtime tomorrow at work.  

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/74_Blockchain.py]

### R1D75
Today's Progress**: I made some stylistic changes to the website to make it look better: adding an opacity property to my CSS flag tags, fixing the views.py and urls.py files to accepts a few link requests, adding an html page called 'login' and better centering my u1 bar with li tags at the top of the page (this still needs work to flow with all browsers).

Thoughts: I did a few things today I have been meaning to do for a while. I'm happy the site is finally looking like a site, although it doesn't do much yet. I actually don't need to make it pretty yet-my objective is functionality in the beginning so that mean most of my html is complete-now it is a matter of building some widgets and adding backend functionality (obviously the hard part). But I have confidence I can do it! 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/75_ViewsandUrlsUpdates.py]

## R1D76
Today's Progress**: I worked on some Python code as well as some Django injections into the html for my register.html and login.html pages, but was not able to get them to work yet. I am, however, a little closer to understanding GET and POST requests (at least I know they are there and what they do). Tomorrow I want to look back over the Django documentation so that I can be able to construct registration and login forms at will. I do predict that the database end make take some time to learn also, which I haven't even touched upon.  

Thoughts: I wanted to be able to create standard user accounts today and I didn't hit that goal. Other than my other goals, better understanding blockchain programming in Python, and basic Javascript (both of which I am working at every day), having a database ready to accept users is a priority. I will work on it as long as it takes.

## R1D77
Today's Progress**: I worked with forms again, this time adding a 'forms.py' file directly to my app directory but still did not get operational results. I learned the 'CSS height: auto' property which helped me align my content within the containers better on anything that is not my homepage (my homepage uses a different template for limited space). I also learned the 'display: flex' property so that I can keep the li tags at the top from switching around when a web browser is made smaller. I cleaned up all the CSS and Html in my project so that all the indentations are set evenly, so that adding code will be easier as I start to build the project further. 

Thoughts: I am glad I took this day to clean up and refactor some of my CSS and Html but am disappointed that I did not get the Django forms working. However, in my prototype timeline my webdesign should be finished well before my database management system so I am still on schedule. I feel like the skills I am learning by making mistakes in Django will ease my implementation for future Python Django code in the future. Lessons well-learned!

## R1D78

Today's Progress**: I learned how to make multiple apps in a Django project work together smoothly. I finally made a successful user submission (new user) form in Django. I learned the lesson that we use a virtual environment because Python changes so often (hence all of my problems getting the correct information to do this task). I learned that the {{}} is used to output data. I also feel I gained a lot of experience in the past 5 days just getting this to work. I am glad I am logging all my journals on this page also, because once I learn this framework I want to build additional sites with it. 

Thoughts: I have not felt a sense of achievement yet in this challenge as the one I did today. That sense of achievement came when I successfully added my first user (first try) on my daily 100 Days of Code Twitter video. I added my newborn daughter, who is the inspiration for me improving myself by undertaking this 100 Days of Code challenge. When I clicked on the admin panel, and saw her name, I really felt good. This might be a small achievement for many, but today was an exciting day to finally put the last 5 days of trial and error to rest for a good result. Even though it started out like any other, worried about not getting this to work, I worked through it after the hour was up, on and on, because it is my one night that I don't have to get up early the next day. (I don't have to work tomorrow until 2:30 pm.) I am so glad I did that. Tomorrow I can rest assured that I have a working interactive database and now I can do some CSS improvements to the new user page.

## R1D79

Today's Progress**: I made a login page in Django, succesfully logged in as a user from the frontend, worked on dynamic Html and CSS (including adding a metatag in the head, some Html dynamic concepts, and the @media CSS tag). I learned more about Javascript today as well. 

Thoughts: I am happy that I have a user-capable database now, with the capacity to login, even though logins don't really do anything yet. In the near future I need to start building the actual functionality of the barter engine. I am very excited to get everything running.

## R1D80

Today's Progress**: Today I successfully traced back a few Django backend errors-still not able to get the blog up and running however. I now want to change gears a bit and just set everything up in another app (since I have already set up a second one). I know everything can be done because I have done this. I just am having a problem having two different base files (still different names of course). I also worked a bit on my home page, playing around with some html and learning a little bit about the <optgroup> tag which places a heading over your menu items in a list dropdown.  

Thoughts: I've been told that I am going to need more javascript to most efficiently do what I am trying to do, and I know that I do. In fact, I don't think my html and CSS skills are up to par either, so I have a lot of work to do in the last twenty days of 100 Days of Code. What has started out as an adventure in Python has evolved into something incorporating Python with many other different languages that I need to know more about. I do best when the learning curve is high though, and I will stay on this until it is finished, even if project completion comes during my second round of 100 Days.

### R1D81 
Today's Progress**: I created a user logout page with all necessary Django dependencies and successfully logged out a user. Unfortunately, I got a csrf token error when I went to log in a user again. I think this is a minor issue. I also worked in CSS select boxes and examined my admin blog problem, which is now bigger than it was before because some of the words I have changed.  

Thoughts: I continued this project in Django because I wanted to continue my Python journey. I find the process to be somewhat complicated, solving one issue to simply create another one. I do have to consider that most opinions about the Python backend are good, and that a big part of the problem is that I still don't fully understand everything that is going on here, and every day I get on and work with it, and that to me, is worth it, whether I choose to use Django in the long-run or not. I have learned a whole lot about basic computer science by successfully solving some of the little riddles to get Django working correctly. I am also quicker in Windows which helps me in my current job of teaching basic web design to middle-schoolers.

### R1D82 
Today's Progress**: Today I learned and added some new CSS properties to the site-mostly as placeholder content to get an idea of what I want the engine to do and how to present it. The -appearance: none property (along with browser specific prefixes of webkit, moz, o, or ms) will take away browser defaults in the select boxes. I also learned about the em units in CSS-set to the last parent size (or some other default if no parent). I don't know everything about it yet, but it improved the look of the text on my site. I also used border-radius to get rounded edges. 

Thoughts: I'm not sure if I want use border radius on the site. They look good now, as a change, but in the next few days I will decide whether sharp or rounded corners look beter, and/or for which windows. I like that I have finally filled up the homepage, even if it is neither dynamic nor operational yet. I have a rough idea of what I want this site to look like-it is simplistic by nature, so I don't want to spend much time trying to make it pretty-I just want it to be resource-light for any bandwidth.

### R1D83 
Today's Progress**:  I spent a few hours learning the framework a bit better-all of the supporting .py files and how they interact with the html via Django's markup language. Then I went in and fixed my blog page-it still isnt completely functional because I feel I will have a better handle on the last part of it after a night of rest. It's further along than it was before I broke it, however. I learned the importance of starting new apps in Django instead of writing to existing ones. The only reason I didn't do that for this one (and I may in the future) was because I did not want to risk losing the blog entries that I have already made. I know that for a more experienced developer this would not be any problem, but the satisfaction of going in and fixing something that I had broken and making it better taught me more than just starting a new app. As I develop, I may take that on as a mini-project-migrating everything to a separate app. The blog, however, isn't a big part of the project. Lesson learned. I also learned more about applying the for operator in Django's markup language. The logic of it will help me in the near future when I start to work with user-input. 

Thoughts: Today brought another sense of accomplishment with little front-end beauty to show for it. Fixing that blog, even though it would have been quicker to just redo it in a new app, gave me the feeling that I broke something and then fixed it again. This is what I need to do to become a better developer and learn the Django framework at a deeper level.

### R1D84 
Today's Progress**:  Today I successfully implemented the timestamp into the blog portion of my website. While it is an internal thing, I now have more experience troubleshooting Django source files. I also worked on my Login issue and learned why variables and attributes in a function of a large project really need to relate and be simple to comprehend for another pair of eyes, or even the original developer's eyes a month later. If code is written cleanly, a lot of comments will not be needed, and comments don't fix errors when you don't know where the error is. If attributes and variables are written correctly, or using good logic, maybe an error will never be made in the first place. 

Thoughts: Yesterday I watched tutorials and did some Python Django code but didn't count the day since I didn't produce anything of substance. I am happy to get the time stamp on the blog working. This is a small step but has improved my ability to fix things in a program (instead of just deleting everything and starting over). Once I am a developer working on real projects, I will not be able to just delete everything and start over. This project now has some work behind it, and it would be a shame to accidentally delete a file and really have to start the whole project over.

### R1D85 
Today's Progress**:  Today I created user output (returning username) to the website with the {{ request.user }} Django template tag. I also learned about *args and **kwargs and their ability to take a variable-length list of arguments. I also learned to create, and create content within, a page without using an HTML document with urls.py and views.py. It's a simple task with little application but the idea of it helps one to understand this framework. I am going to practice doing this in different forms. 

Thoughts: Maybe I have said this before, but it is great to start "getting" Django. Maybe I have had a few of these moments, and there is no beautiful work yet, but today I went a step closer to using the interaction between the files, and between the Django server and the frontend, to create a URL without an HTML page by using a Python string. I am not sure this has much of an applied use, but it is nice to see how it works in order to understand other things in the future.

### R1D86 
Today's Progress**:  I learned about the GIL, or global interpreter lock, a mechanism which restricts an interpreter to restrict thread execution so that only one native thread can execute at a time. I learned about what CPython actually is, which is 1. a compiler to convert Python to bytecode, 2. a VM, or virtual machine, to run bytecode, and 3. a C interface to interact with the VM. When a user types 'python' into the command prompt, it is CPython that is doing the work to load the environment. I also learned about redirects from my login page and default templates from DIR in the TEMPLATES section of settings.py. 

Thoughts: I only kept a couple lines of code today, one of which I believe will even be productive. I did, however, learn a lot about CPython and what it actually is. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/86_ChangesToSettings.py]


### R1D87 
Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about CPython, which essentially covers the basics of what Python is actually doing right down to the core C commands that Python is actually running. Understanding it seems to be a must for core developers, but it seems like even the lectures contain a lot of "I don't know" and "I'll have to check that" answers to questions which tells me it is a very complex topic. I learned about visualizing modules as simploy .py files (maybe obvious to those with an extensive CS background but I really hadn't thought about it in such simple terms even though I knew what I was doing when I imported them). I also worked with one of my own modules, the Fibonacci sequence from Day 3. 

Thoughts: I'm glad I can continue and add on to my earlier work. This is the value in the 100 Days of Code challenge combined with  little organization. My comments probably seem obvious to some-it's hard to believe I only half-knew what I was doing every time I would do an import. Now I am chaining together variables from the different modules that I have written. Simple baby steps today, but such an enlightening bit of work! The work with Django and Pandas, specifically, have taught me more about working across files, not just in one .py file or importing stuff that others have written and included in the library. I am happy to finally get this idea.

### R1D88 
Today's Progress**:  Today before coding I watched more lectures in the CPython 10-hour series that I have been watching in the last few days. I learned about the open() and read() functions that can be used to view the contents of a Python file. I also further learned about importing files and writing functions in those modules-I fixed the function to do what I wanted today, imported the contents, and plotted the quotients of the last two numbers using several upper limits. I was surprised that the quotient actually went up and down. 

Thoughts: Day by day, I am getting much more fluent in using multiple files and programs at once. On my Twitter video I imported my Day 3 work (now written as a function), arranged the data, used matplotlib to plot the points, then opened the command prompt and read the Fib.py file. These are the kinds of things I aimed for during my 100 Days of Code. I am happy so far. I also learned some HTML today, wrote the file up in Notepad (to practice without Intellisense) and then opened the file with Firefox. It worked the first time!

### R1D89 
Today's Progress**: I concluded an overview of CPython and the inner-working of the language we know as Python. This dive has taught me a lot about what Python actually is, and why it is slower than other languages. I learned the disassemble command from the prompt, which takes a program and shows the compiled bytecode. I also used many new functions for examining data, including dir(var) to see all possible operations on the object, type(var) to see the type of the variable, id(var) to see the unique (random) number assigned to the object in memory, and oct(int) to show the base 8 representation of an int variable. 

Thoughts: I really think that 100 Days of Code tests one's time management ability. I have dealt with time management issues before and have learned to prioritize and work through things as they are necessary, so maybe my time management skills are better than some people's, but they are still not perfect.

### R1D90 
Today's Progress**:  I learned about the URL dispatcher to map URL paths to views. I also dove into some CSS and learned about the selector (HTML tag to initiate CSS) and the declaration (the property and value). This leads into the fact that there are three main types of CSS: that which is local to the current HTML tag, known as Inline, that which is global in the document, specified in the <head> tagand known as Internal, and that which is universal to the webpage and written in a .css file, which is known as External. 

Thoughts: I didn't bring my computer to work today so when I finally got home, it was pretty late. I decided to delete and rebuild the accounts app. While I know it is good experience to delete and rebuild stuff, I try to never just start over on something. Well, now I am left with an even bigger mess than before. I hope to be able to dedicate an entire day to cleaning up this project so far soon. Although it is frustrating, I know this is how to learn it. 

Link to work:** [https://github.com/equitymarkets/100-days-of-code/blob/master/90_URLSproblem.py]


### R1D91 
Today's Progress**: Today I deleted the accounts app from my project (again). At least I still have a project to work with. That also took some time to get that working though. I deleted every footprint from the project in order for the runserver commannd to even work again. I ran into the ' ' is not a registered namespace, and the way to fix that was to delete an obsolete Django injection from an old piece of commented out html code. I ran into a reverse match error, and to fix that I have to go through almost all the html files to find one backlink to an obsolete views file. In all, I deleted one entire app directory and information from AT LEAST to urls.py files, two views.py files, the settings.py app declaration, and several html documents. I also started using the CSS button description and explored input[type=text] vs input[type=submit]. I didn't get that working like I wanted, but I was able to segregate a register button from the standard blue default buttons higher up on the page by actually specifying a button type and changing it from "input" to "button". 

Thoughts: I feel somehow satisfied. I ran into a ton of errors and fixed them. After one hour of troubleshooting, I wanted something to show visually for today so I played with some HTML and CSS, cleaning up the bottom left corner of my homepage. So, even though my accounts app isn't working yet, I am ready to start fresh, and with a better home page and a lot more Django experience to work with.

### R1D92 
Today's Progress**: Today I overcame the "NameError: name 'path' is not defined" error. It shouldn't have taken me so long to figure out that I was not importing path. Of course, the main URLS.py file had this so I should have at least just tried it. Next time if I hit this error I will have some idea of what is going on and I will be able to remedy it much faster. I also had another Django html injection problem-when I was trying to import my base.html page, I only wrote {% 'base.html' %} but I needed to provide 'forest/' in front of the html file because it is in another directory. This was something I learned while learning Jupyter earlier in this challenge, so I was able to remedy it pretty quickly. 

Thoughts: I see now part of the reason why I had so many problems getting to the bottom of this problem. When dealing with Python and Django, one must be aware of the differences across versions of both and operating systems as well. I have not found any online how-to guides that fully describe how to do a task on my machine using my environment. It does teach one a lot about the big picture though.

### R1D93 
Today's Progress**: Today I finished Django Milestone Number 4: the account system. I can separate my learning in Django to four big achievements: 1. setting up the virtual environment, 2. correctly setting a static library for CSS and JS files, 3. making an admin blog page, and 4. finishing my accounts app. I encountered many errors but I finally got it working in my environment. I created a new user, logged it in, logged out, logged in an existing user, and logged out again. Today was a success for me.  

Thoughts: When I look back on what I have done so far during 100 Days of Code I feel pretty good. I have used Python in several environments, including IDLE, Geany, Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook, PowerShell, and even directly from the Command Prompt. I solved several well-known CS riddles, including Monty Hall and Towers of Hanoi. I coded five sorting algorithms and one search algorithm. I explored several data science libraries including MatplotLib, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn, and coded several visualizations including some CS, financial, and economic data, my AI advancement theory being but one of them. And I have used Django to work on a project that I plan to take live soon. I don't know how long it will be until I do 100 Days of Code again after this, but I think I will return soon. I definitely have been introduced to a like-minded community on Twitter. That is a very positive thing.

### R1D94 
Today's Progress**: Today I did some prototyping as related to the actual flow of user input data; thinking and writing out what exactly needs to go where. I initiated a new app called trade, and I wrote two models (which are subject to change) to eventually create a trade list and a wishlist. I reviewed Get and Post requests; it seems that most Django projects simply use these two requests, although a sophisticated API may use more. I encountered the error "NameError: Name "model" is not defined". My fix was to go back in and notice that I had typed (models, Model) instead of (models.Model) in the parameters for both of the new models.   

Thoughts: I am now flowing slow. Errors take less time to remedy, and although I do not always know what to type and where, I know where to easily find it. Realistically, I think that 100 Days of Code (so far) has lifted me from about a 2 out of 10 in Python functionality (completely new to Python but not to coding) to a solid 3 and hopefully a 4 by the time the challenge is finished. Now since I have a couple projects going and am in the habit, I will continue to code and perhaps start another round in a few weeks after it ends.
