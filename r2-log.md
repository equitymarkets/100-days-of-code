### R2D1
Today's Progress**: I downloaded an emulator to play with old Commodore VIC20 BASIC programs. I went through a few old commands, including LIST, NEW, and PRINT. I also refreshed myself on the FOR loop and build a small program to make some little characters appear to  scroll down the page. 

Thoughts: During a trip to my parent's house over the holidays, I was cleaning out some old drawers. I found a manual from my first computer-a Commodore VIC 20 and I decided that I would work through the exercises, some of which I had done so many years ago, and some of which I hadn't (I was a very young kid at this time with a short attention span.) I really believe looking into this old manual will enlighten me on some basics about computer science that are overlooked in today's tech-heavy environment, but that, nevertheless, remain very relevant to understand.
